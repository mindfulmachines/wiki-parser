'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] often defined as [[self-governance|self-governed]] voluntary institutions,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies.&quot; George Woodcock. &quot;Anarchism&quot; at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. &quot;Anarchism&quot; from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 &quot;Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.&quot; Judith Suissa. ''Anarchism and Education: a Philosophical Perspective''. Routledge. New York. 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iaf-ifa.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.&quot; [[Peter Kropotkin]]. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Anarchism__its_philosophy_and_ideal.html Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__An_Anarchist_FAQ__03_17_.html#toc2 &quot;B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?&quot;] in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism holds the [[state (polity)|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;

There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a &quot;classless&quot; or &quot;libertarian&quot; society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.&quot; [[Murray Bookchin]]. ''The Ecology of Freedom: the emergence and dissolution of Hierarchy. CHESHIRE BOOKS
Palo Alto. 1982. Pg. 3''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Authority is defined in terms of the right to exercise social control (as explored in the &quot;sociology of power&quot;) and the correlative duty to obey (as explored in the &quot;philosophy of practical reason&quot;). Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those &quot;authoritative&quot; powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation.&quot;[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism'' by Paul McLaughlin. AshGate. 2007. p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.&quot; [[Emma Goldman]]. &quot;What it Really Stands for Anarchy&quot; in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows &quot;They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism&amp;nbsp;... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.  representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.&quot; [[Benjamin Tucker]].

As an anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy.

==Etymology and terminology==
{{Related articles|Anarchist terminology}}

The term ''[[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]]'' is a compound word composed from the word ''[[anarchy]]'' and the suffix ''[[-ism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anarchism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Anarchism], [[Online etymology dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; themselves derived respectively from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἀναρχία}}, i.e. ''anarchy''&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)narxi/a|ἀναρχία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy], [[Merriam-Webster]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anarchy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Anarchy], [[Online etymology dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; (from {{lang|grc|ἄναρχος}}, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;one without rulers&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/narxos|ἄναρχος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[privative]] prefix [[privative alpha|ἀν]]- (''an-'', i.e. &quot;without&quot;) and {{lang|grc|ἀρχός}}, ''archos'', i.e. &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)rxo/s|ἀρχός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf.

First Known Use: 1539&quot; [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy &quot;Anarchy&quot; at Merriam Webster dictionary online]&lt;/ref&gt;''Anarchist'' was the term adopted by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of, though among these &quot;anarchists&quot; there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Wilhelm Weitling]], but they did not use the word ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Anarchists |last=Joll |first=James |year=1964 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-03642-5 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s, and beginning in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''libertarianism'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At the end of the century in France, Sebastien Faure took up a word used in 1858 by one Joseph Dejacque to make it the title of a journal, Le Libertaire. Today the terms &quot;anarchist&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; have become interchangeable.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html#toc2 ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice''] [[Daniel Guérin]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dean.

The French [[Renaissance humanism|renaissance]] political philosopher [[Étienne de La Boétie]] wrote in his most famous work the ''Discourse on Voluntary Servitude'' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Several historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify La Botie's treatise itself as anarchist, which is incorrect since La botie never extended his analysis from tyrannical government to government per se. But while La Botie cannot be considered an anarchist, his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the universality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansion.[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=6o-8P3iqf7IC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=anarchism+la+boetie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z79GU1rW1t&amp;sig=4ini7oZUie2U8-P0BpMLogXYWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eAOFUJCYJ4Le9AT_iYG4DA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anarchism%20la%20boetie&amp;f=false ''Introduction to The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude'' by Murray Rothbard. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Quite rightly, La Boëtie recognizes the potential for domination in any democracy: the democratic leader, elected by the people, becomes intoxicated with his own power and teeters increasingly towards tyranny. Indeed, we can see modern democracy itself as an instance of voluntary servitude on a mass scale. It is not so much that we participate in an illusion whereby we are deceived by elites into thinking we have a genuine say in decision-making. It is rather that democracy itself has encouraged a mass contentment with powerlessness and a general love of submission.&quot;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/saul-newman-voluntary-servitude-reconsidered-radical-politics-and-the-problem-of-self-dominatio &quot;Voluntary Servitude Reconsidered: Radical Politics and the Problem of Self-Domination&quot;] [[Saul Newman]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The radical [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant Christian]] [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and his group the [[Diggers]] are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchists have regarded the secular revolt of the Diggers, or True Levellers, in seventeenth-century England led by Gerrard Winstanley as a source of pride. Winstanley, deeming that property is corrupting, opposed clericalism, political power and privilege. It is economic inequality, he believed, that produces crime and misery. He championed a primitive communalism based on the pure teachings of God as comprehended through reason.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kenneth_C._Wenzer__Godwin_s_Place_in_the_Anarchist_Tradition___a_Bicentennial_Tribute.html Kenneth C. Wenzer. &quot;Godwin's Place in the Anarchist Tradition — a Bicentennial Tribute&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the [[Levellers]] and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''.&quot; Marlow. &quot;Anarchism and Christianity&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609 – c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving. In 1649–1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods.&quot; George Woodcock Anarchism The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;anarchist&quot; first entered the English language in 1642, during the [[English Civil War]], as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006.

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115&quot;&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence&amp;nbsp;...&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Godwin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt;]]
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in ''[[Political Justice]]'' (1793)&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116&quot;&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson |oclc=2340417 |origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, [[property rights]] and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.

The French [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is regarded as the first ''self-proclaimed'' anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, ''[[What is Property?]],'' published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, &quot;Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order.&quot; In ''What is Property?'' Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (''propriété''), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted this with what he called &quot;possession,&quot; or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that &quot;Property is Liberty,&quot; and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Stewart. Introduction to ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', Anchor Books, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. 1969, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W.

According to [[George Woodcock]] &quot;These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock.

One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included {{quote|[[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers, and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised&amp;nbsp;... Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the &quot;implementation of the binding mandate&quot; in 1848&amp;nbsp;... and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|title=The Paris Commune|work=blackened.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} George Woodcock states:

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organisation of labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

In response, unions across the United States prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-00600-8 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 |isbn=0-691-04711-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 |isbn=0-7178-0624-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.&lt;ref name=foner&gt;{{cite book | last = Foner | first = Philip Sheldon | title = May day: a short history of the international workers' holiday, 1886–1986 | publisher = International Publishers | location = New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-7178-0624-3 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A.

The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58&amp;nbsp;million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the [[International Workers Association]], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular &quot;The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazil]], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]&amp;nbsp;... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;

===Propaganda of the deed and illegalism===
{{Main|Propaganda of the deed|Illegalism|Expropriative anarchism}}
[[File:Lugi Gallean2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Italian-American]] anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]. His followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on 'tyrants' and 'enemies of the people']]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title=&quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, 25 July 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=21 April 2003 |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s, and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '[[Confiscation|expropriations]]'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20090312022528 |url=http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm |title=&quot;Anarchist-Communism&quot; by Alain Pengam }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it &quot;The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;[[individual reappropriation]]&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be ''exemplary'' invitations to revolt.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm|title=The Illegalists - By Doug Imrie|work=recollectionbooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labour movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favoured individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion – in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{cite news |author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July–August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}}) &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organisation may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] of France, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], King [[Umberto I of Italy]], President [[William McKinley]] of the United States, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and King [[George I of Greece]]. McKinley's assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. The image of the anarchist throwing a bomb remains to this day.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the [[1917 October Revolution]].

===Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s===
{{Main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolutions of 1917–23}}
[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt uprising]], before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist&quot; Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldman | first = Emma | title = [[My Disillusionment in Russia]] |chapter=Preface |page=xx | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-486-43270-X |quote= My critic further charged me with believing that &quot;had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx&quot; the result would have been different and more satisfactory. I plead guilty to the charge. In truth, I not only believe so; I am certain of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organisations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition |title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8047-0293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutions of 1917–23|revolutionary wave of 1917–23]] saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] which established the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] the anarchists [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Erich Mühsam]] had important leadership positions within the revolutionary [[Council communism|councilist]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Munich Soviet (or &quot;Council Republic&quot;) of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though — like most revolutions — its stated goals were not exactly &quot;temporary.&quot; Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B. Traven), gave the Soviet a distinct anarchist flavor.&quot; [[Hakim Bey]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the ''[[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]'',&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=24 October 2006 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070311013533/http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000| archivedate= 11 March 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supported.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The veteran Italian anarchist, [[Luigi Fabbri]], was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;wordpress&quot;/&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''.

In Germany the anarchist [[Erich Mühsam]] was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the [[Reichstag fire]] in Berlin. [[Joseph Goebbels]], the Nazi [[Propagandaministerium|propaganda minister]], labelled him as one of &quot;those Jewish subversives.&quot; Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at [[Sonnenburg]], Brandenburg and finally, [[Oranienburg]]. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] at [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]] when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot; Shepherd&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mühsam|first=Erich|editor=David A.

{{Main|Spanish Revolution}}
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' [[social revolution]] that began during the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] and more broadly [[libertarian socialist]] organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily [[Catalonia]], [[Anarchist Aragon|Aragon]], [[Andalusia]], and parts of [[Levante, Spain|the Levante]]. Much of [[Spain's economy]] was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like [[Catalonia]], the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] influence, as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied party actively resisted attempts at [[collectivization]] enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, [[agriculture|agrarian]] areas became collectivised and run as [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] [[commune (intentional community)|communes]]. Anarchist historian [[Sam Dolgoff]] estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution,&lt;ref name=Dolgoff1974&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Paul Goodman.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], influential American anarchist author of ''[[Growing Up Absurd|Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized Society]]'' among other works critical of contemporary societies.]] Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between [[synthesis anarchism]] and [[platformism]] took importance once again especially in the [[Anarchism in Italy#Postwar years and today|anarchist movements of Italy]] and [[Anarchism in France#The Fourth Republic (1945–1958)|France]].

The guarantees of the 1940 Constitution permitted them to legally create an organization of this type, and it was thus that they agreed to dissolve the two principal Cuban anarchist organizations, the SIA and FGAC, and create a new, unified group, the Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (ALC), a sizable organization with a membership in the thousands.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Frank_Fernandez__Cuban_Anarchism__The_History_of_A_Movement.html#toc8 ''Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement'' by Frank Fernandez]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertgraham.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939-1977)|work=Robert Graham's Anarchism Weblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 in [[Anarchism in France|France]] the [[Fédération Anarchiste]] and the anarchosyndicalist trade union [[Confédération nationale du travail]] was established in the next year while the also [[Synthesist anarchism|synthesist]] [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] was founded in [[Anarchism in Italy|Italy]].

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] became influential in the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the forties and fifties, anarchism, in fact if not in name, began to reappear, often in alliance with pacifism, as the basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/] The anarchist/pacifist wing of the peace movement was small in comparison with the wing of the movement that emphasized electoral work, but made an important contribution to the movement as a whole. Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle.&quot;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence.

He explains that their pacifism, anarchism, and commitment to the downtrodden were one of the important models and inspirations for the 1960s. As Farrell puts it, &quot;Catholic Workers identified the issues of the sixties before the Sixties began, and they offered models of protest long before the protest decade.&quot;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/268 &quot;The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism&quot; by James J.

But the movements of the sixties were driven by concerns that were more compatible with an expressive style of politics, with hostility to authority in general and state power in particular&amp;nbsp;... By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement.&quot; [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 in [[Carrara]], Italy the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the [[Fédération anarchiste|Fédération Anarchiste]]), the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] of Italy and the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History.

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and anarchist historian [[Andrej Grubacic]] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those &quot;who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits&quot; of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are &quot;much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], ecological and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas&quot;, and who by the turn of the 21st century formed &quot;by far the majority&quot; of anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;[[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]], &quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century]&quot;, [[ZNet]].

Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; According to anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]], &quot;contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]&amp;nbsp;... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Critchley#Infinitely Demanding|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]].

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]]; the CNT-AIT in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html%20Website%20of%20the%20Confédération%20Nationale%20du%20Travail%20-%20Association%20Internationale%20des%20Travailleurs http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html Website of the Confédération Nationale du Travail – Association Internationale des Travailleurs]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|Union Sindicale Italiana]] in Italy; in the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]]  and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]] and [[Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)|Anarchist Federation]].

{{Main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] and social anarchist thinkers.]]
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]], which embodies the theoretical stance that the [[state (polity)|state]] lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12).

(Mar., 1986), pp. 300–02.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, &quot;necessary evil&quot; but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was &quot;[[anarchism without adjectives]]&quot;, a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the &quot;bitter debates&quot; of anarchist theory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical anarchist schools of thought===

====Mutualism====
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0-8020-5458-7 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist [[William Batchelder Greene]], each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul.

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115&quot;/&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116&quot;/&gt; Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

====Social anarchism====
{{Main|Social anarchism}}
{{Libertarian socialism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens&amp;nbsp;... the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot; [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secGint.html Section G – Is individualist anarchism capitalistic?] ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;&gt;&quot;The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use.

This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or ''[[propaganda by the deed]]'', which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt;

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism.

=====Anarcho-syndicalism=====
{{Main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|May day demonstration of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], Basque Country in 2010]]Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the [[trade union|labour movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labour unions]] as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[Direct action]] and [[Workers' self-management]]
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]] – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. [[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labour movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with [[feminism]]. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary [[Coercion|coercive]] hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]]. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice-versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].

[[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought, drawing from diverse ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomist marxism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[Situationist International]], and [[postcolonialism]].

[[Left-wing market anarchism]] strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Writing before the rise of the Carson–Long school of left-libertarianism, historian of American anarchism David DeLeon was disinclined to treat any market-oriented variant of libertarianism as leftist; see DeLeon, David (1978).

Cp. Tucker, &quot;Socialism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;But there has always been a market-oriented strand of libertarian socialism that emphasizes voluntary cooperation between producers. And markets, properly understood, have always been about cooperation. As a commenter at Reason magazine’s Hit&amp;Run blog, remarking on Jesse Walker’s link to the Kelly article, put it:  “every trade is a cooperative act.” In fact, it’s a fairly common observation among market anarchists that genuinely free markets have the most legitimate claim to the label “socialism.”&quot;.[http://c4ss.org/content/670 &quot;Socialism: A Perfectly Good Word Rehabilitated&quot;] by [[Kevin Carson]] at website of Center for a Stateless Society&lt;/ref&gt;

However Rothbard’s claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism. In sum, the “anarchy” of Libertarianism reduces to a liberal fraud.[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-sabatini-libertarianism-bogus-anarchy &quot;Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy&quot; by Peter Sabatini] in issue #41 (Fall/Winter 1994–95) of ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].{{-}}

An important current within anarchism is [[free love]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ncc-1776&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html |title=The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy |publisher=Ncc-1776.org |date=1 December 1996 |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101231195631/http://ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html| archivedate= 31 December 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–50.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895–1897 as ''The Firebrand''; 1897–1904 as ''Free Society'') was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-MSF-551&quot;&gt;&quot;''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.&quot; ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909'', p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication advocated [[free love]] and [[women's rights]], and critiqued &quot;[[Comstockery]]&quot; – censorship of sexual information. Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;

In New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sochen, June. 1972. ''The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910–1920.'' New York: Quadrangle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''Der arme Teufel''. In Argentina anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] published the newspaper called ''{{lang|es|La Voz de la Mujer}}'' (English: The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;molyneux&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Molyneux|first=Maxine|title=Women's movements in international perspective: Latin America and beyond|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2001|page=24|isbn=978-0-333-78677-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yg9HFrOG89kC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Emile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf |title=E. Armand and &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot; – Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In Germany the [[stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. [[Mujeres Libres]] was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], Mercedes Comaposada and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a &quot;double struggle&quot; for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and [[social revolution]] and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html Mujeres Libres – Women anarchists in the Spanish Revolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] was a main founder of the Spanish [[anarcha-feminist]] federation [[Mujeres Libres]] who was open about her [[lesbian]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wzar.unizar.es/siem/articulos/Premios/MujeresLibres.pdf &quot;basta pensar en el lesbianismo de Lucía Sánchez Saornil&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore [[lesbian]] themes&lt;ref&gt;&quot;R. Fue una época transgresora, emergió el feminismo y la libertad sexual estuvo en el candelero. Hay rastreos de muchas lesbianas escritoras: Carmen Conde[primera académica de número], Victorina Durán, Margarita Xirgu, Ana María Sagi, la periodista Irene Polo, Lucía Sánchez Saornil, fundadora de Mujeres Libres[sección feminista de CNT]... Incluso existía un círculo sáfico en Madrid como lugar de encuentro y tertulia. P. ¿Se declaraban lesbianas? R. Había quien no se escondía mucho, como Polo o Durán, pero lesbiana era un insulto, algo innombrable. Excepto los poemas homosexuales de Sánchez Saornil, sus textos no eran explícitos para poder publicarlos, así que hay que reinterpretarlos.&quot;[http://elpais.com/diario/2007/12/06/paisvasco/1196973608_850215.html &quot;Tener referentes serios de lesbianas elimina estereotipos&quot; by Juan Fernandez at ''El Pais'']&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to [[censorship]] and punishment.

More recently, the British [[anarcho-pacifist]] [[Alex Comfort]] gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of [[free love]] has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

===Libertarian education and freethought===

His educational experiments, for example, possibly under the influence of the Swiss educational theorist [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (via [[Robert Owen|Owen]]), emphasized – as we would expect – the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children, not the inculcation of pre-conceived values.[http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm &quot;Introduction of The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren&quot; by Crispin Sartwell]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Stirner]] wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it Stirner names his educational principle &quot;personalist,&quot; explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create &quot;free men, sovereign characters,&quot; by which he means &quot;eternal characters&amp;nbsp;... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |title=The False Principle of our Education|author=Max Stirner |publisher=Tmh.floonet.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States &quot;freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt; &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''...&amp;nbsp;The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established &quot;modern&quot; or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: &quot;Por la Verdad y la Justicia&quot; |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–132   |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 |publisher=History of Education Society |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to &quot;[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting&quot;. Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in &quot;freedom in education&quot;, education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html| archivedate= 7 August 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote: &quot;This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''The Spanish anarchists: the heroic years, 1868–1936''. AK Press, 1998, p. 115. ISBN 1-873176-04-X&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;/&gt; [[Cuba]], South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901. Russian [[christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]] established a school for peasant children on his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html &quot;The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance&quot; by Matt Hern]&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.N. | title = Tolstoy | publisher = Norton, W. W. &amp; Company, Inc. | year = 2001 | page = xxi | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=imYmH8myBUsC&amp;pg=PR19 |  isbn = 0-393-32122-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt; He thought that &quot;Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself&amp;nbsp;... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt; For him &quot;without compulsion, education was transformed into culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt;

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]] manifested that &quot;A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of &quot;hearts not heads in the school&quot;. Though he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing.&quot; [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy  ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |date=September–October 2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{Main|Criticisms of anarchism}}
Criticisms of anarchism include [[morality|moral]] criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book ''European Socialism'' argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He also argued that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Autism''' is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] characterized by impaired [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]], [[language acquisition|verbal]] and [[non-verbal communication]], and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; The signs typically develop gradually, but some children with autism will reach their [[developmental milestones]] at a normal pace and then [[Regressive autism|regress]].&lt;ref name=Stefanatos/&gt; 

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
Autism is highly heritable, but the cause includes both environmental factors and genetic susceptibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |author=Goldani AA, Downs SR, Widjaja F, Lawton B, Hendren RL |title=Biomarkers in autism |journal=Front Psychiatry |volume=5  |pages=100 |year=2014 |pmid=25161627 |pmc=4129499 |doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; [[Controversies in autism|Controversies]] surround other proposed environmental [[Causes of autism|causes]];&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; for example, the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and have been disproven in scientific studies. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|diagnostic criteria]] require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{vcite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Autism Spectrum Disorder, 299.00 (F84.0) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pagex = 50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism affects information processing in the [[Human brain|brain]] by altering how nerve cells and their [[synapse]]s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; It is one of three recognized disorders in the [[autism spectrum]] (ASDs), the other two being [[Asperger syndrome]], which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and [[PDD-NOS|pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified]] (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
[[Early intensive behavior intervention|Early behavioral]], cognitive, or speech interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; Although there is no known cure,&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; there have been reported cases of children who recovered.&lt;ref name=Helt/&gt; Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howlin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Howlin P, Goode S, Hutton J, Rutter M | title = Adult outcome for children with autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–29 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14982237 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00215.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be [[Autism rights movement|accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder]].&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
As of 2010 the rate of autism is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASD Data and Statistics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |title = ASD Data and Statistics |website = CDC.gov |accessdate= 5 Apr 2014 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140418153648/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |archivedate = 2014-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MMWR2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors =  | title = Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders&amp;nbsp;— autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 14 sites, United States, 2008 | journal = MMWR Surveill Summ | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–19 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22456193 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm | archivedate = 2014-03-25 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140325235639/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHSR65&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Blumberg SJ, Bramlett MD, Kogan MD, Schieve LA, Jones JR, Lu MC | title = Changes in prevalence of parent-reported autism spectrum disorder in school-aged U.S. children: 2007 to 2011-2012 | journal = Natl Health Stat Report | volume = | issue = 65 | pages = 1–11 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24988818 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr065.pdf | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6JoG0uE7r|archivedate=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%.&lt;ref name=NHSEstimating/&gt; The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHSR65&quot;/&gt; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Rogers SJ | title = What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? | journal = Autism Res | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–37 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19582867 | pmc = 2791538 | doi = 10.1002/aur.81  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales |author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]] |publisher=Knopf |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-679-43785-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A | title = Early detection of core deficits in autism | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–33 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15666338 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most childen with autism display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van Ijzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA | title = Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–34 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15257669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#Face perception in individuals with autism|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigman&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT | title = Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives | journal = Annu Rev Clin Psychol | volume = 2 | pages = 327–55 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17716073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and [[tantrum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M | title = Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 567–79 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 16973329 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G | title = The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability | journal = J Intellect Disabil Res | volume = 50 | issue = 9 | pages = 621–32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16901289 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Johnson CP, Myers SM | title = Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 120 | issue = 5 | pages = 1183–215 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17967920 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-2361 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090208013449/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org:80/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 | archivedate = 2009-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Landa R | title = Early communication development and intervention for children with autism | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–25 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17326115 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tager-Flusberg&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E | title = Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders | journal = Pediatr Clin North Am | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 469–81 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17543905 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt; categorizes as follows.

[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Young boy asleep on a bed, facing the camera, with only the head visible and the body off-camera. On the bed behind the boy's head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line.|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
* '''[[Stereotypy]]''' is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* '''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.
* '''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* '''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lam-Aman&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–66 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy or game.
* '''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; 
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH | title = Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–43 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11055459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005596502855 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other symptoms===

The [[mirror neuron system]] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;MNS and autism:

From studies based on [[event-related potential]]s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Jeste SS, Nelson CA | title = Event related potentials in the understanding of autism spectrum disorders: an analytical review | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–510 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18850262 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-008-0652-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[magnetoencephalography]] studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Roberts TP, Schmidt GL, Egeth M, Blaskey L, Rey MM, Edgar JC, Levy SE | title = Electrophysiological signatures: magnetoencephalographic studies of the neural correlates of language impairment in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Int J Psychophysiol | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–60 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18336941 | pmc = 2397446 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.01.012 | author. =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]'s [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.&lt;ref name=E-S-theory/&gt;  These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the [[Sally–Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name=&quot;E-S-theory&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S | title = Autism: the empathizing–systemizing (E-S) theory | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1156 | pages = 68–80 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19338503 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x | url = http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131214134422/http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni/&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]]. In his review, Kenworthy states that &quot;the claim of [[executive dysfunction]] as a causal factor in autism is controversial&quot;, however, &quot;it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy/&gt; Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B | title = Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism | journal = Dev Psychopathol | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 1103–32 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18838033 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579408000527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Hill EL | title = Executive dysfunction in autism | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–32 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14697400 | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenworthy&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kenworthy L, Yerys BE, Anthony LG, Wallace GL | title = Understanding executive control in autism spectrum disorders in the lab and in the real world | journal = Neuropsychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 320–38 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18956239 | pmc = 2856078 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9077-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.&lt;ref name=Sigman/&gt;

[[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Happé F, Frith U | title = The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–25 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16450045 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Mottron L, Dawson M, Soulières I, Hubert B, Burack J | title = Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–43 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16453071 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Happé F, Ronald A, Plomin R | title = Time to give up on a single explanation for autism | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 1218–20 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17001340 | doi = 10.1038/nn1770 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | journal = Dev Rev | year = 2007 | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 224–60 | title = Cognitive theories of autism | vauthors = Rajendran G, Mitchell P | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry and psychology|idiosyncratic language]], and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome]], [[intellectual disability]] or global developmental delay.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; [[ICD-10]] uses essentially the same definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICD-10-F84.0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f84 |year=2007 |accessdate=10 October 2009|work=ICD-10: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Tenth Revision|publisher=World Health Organization |title=F84.

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gotham K, Risi S, Dawson G, Tager-Flusberg H, Joseph R, Carter A, Hepburn S, McMahon W, Rodier P, Hyman SL, Sigman M, Rogers S, Landa R, Spence MA, Osann K, Flodman P, Volkmar F, Hollander E, Buxbaum J, Pickles A, Lord C | title = A replication of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) revised algorithms | journal = J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 642–51 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434924 | pmc = 3057666 | doi = 10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816bffb7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [[medical conditions]].&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; A pediatric [[neuropsychologist]] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanne&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE | title = Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Neuropsychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–84 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18855144 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; such as [[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Mantovani JF | title = Autistic regression and Landau–Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? | journal = Dev Med Child Neurol | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–53 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10855658 | doi = 10.1017/S0012162200210621 | title. =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Matson JL, Neal D | title = Cormorbidity: diagnosing comorbid psychiatric conditions | journal = Psychiatr Times | volume = 26 |issue=4 |year=2009|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20130403062215/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 | archivedate = 2013-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ | title = Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Genet Med | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–12 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18197051 | doi = 10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 | laysummary = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php | laydate = 7 February 2008 | laysource = Medical News Today }} {{Wayback|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php|date =20100901151333}}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; A [[Genotype-first approach|genotype-first]] model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ledbetter DH | title = Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 359 | issue = 16 | pages = 1728–30 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18784093 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMe0806570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa3&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Landa RJ | title = Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life | journal = Nat Clin Pract Neurol | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 138–47 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18253102 | doi = 10.1038/ncpneuro0731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dover&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dover CJ, Le Couteur A | title = How to diagnose autism | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 540–5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17515625 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2005.086280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shattuck PT, Grosse SD | title = Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–35 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17563895 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | title = Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research | vauthors = Cass H |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–38|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A | title = Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 108–15 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19220594 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV-TR-299.00&quot;&gt;{{vcite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC|year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |accessdate=|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131029080544/http://www.cdc.gov:80/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Freitag CM | title = The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature | journal = Mol Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–22 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17033636 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'',''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

The manifestations of autism cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[developmentally disabled]], and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, [[pedantic]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Happé F | title = Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure | journal = Psychologist | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 540–7 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120517162434/http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt; Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S | title = The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism | journal = Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 865–72 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16519981 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010 | url = http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120513020615/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf | archivedate = 12 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt; Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed.&lt;ref name=Chaste/&gt;  Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Chaste/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL | title = Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19567888 | pmc = 3712619 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt; Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bertoglio K, Hendren RL | title = New developments in autism | journal = Psychiatr Clin North Am | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19248913 | doi = 10.1016/j.psc.2008.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; They include:
* '''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable [[Mendelian]] (single-gene) condition, [[chromosome abnormality]], or other genetic syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B | title = Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 943–55 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11733747 | doi = 10.1038/35103559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E | title = Childhood autism and associated comorbidities | journal = Brain Dev | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–72 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17084999 | doi = 10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Intellectual disability]]'''. The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter= Learning in autism |author= Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title= Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–72 |editor= Byrne JH (ed.-in-chief), Roediger HL III (vol. ed.) |publisher= Academic Press |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=978-0-12-370504-4 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |accessdate=26 July 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120303191513/http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |archivedate= 3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E | title = Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children | journal = JAMA | volume = 285 | issue = 24 | pages = 3093–9 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11427137 | doi = 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100828195243/http://jama.ama-assn.org:80/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 | archivedate = 2010-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger's excludes intellectual disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book | title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition text revision | publisher=American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC | year=2000 | page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = White SW, Oswald D, Ollendick T, Scahill L | title = Anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–29 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19223098 | pmc = 2692135 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Epilepsy]]''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of [[language disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Spence SJ, Schneider MT | title = The role of epilepsy and epileptiform EEGs in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Pediatr Res | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 599–606 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19454962 | pmc = 2692092 | doi = 10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several '''[[metabolic defect]]s''', such as [[phenylketonuria]], are associated with autistic symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manzi&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Manzi B, Loizzo AL, Giana G, Curatolo P | title = Autism and metabolic diseases | journal = J Child Neurol | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–14 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18079313 | doi = 10.1177/0883073807308698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Minor physical anomalies]]''' are significantly increased in the autistic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ozgen HM, Hop JW, Hox JJ, Beemer FA, van Engeland H | title = Minor physical anomalies in autism: a meta-analysis | journal = Mol Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 18626481 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2008.75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Steyaert JG, De la Marche W | title = What's new in autism? | journal = Eur J Pediatr | volume = 167 | issue = 10 | pages = 1091–101 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597114 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 | title. =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Richdale AL, Schreck KA | title = Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–11 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398354 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leo-Kanner.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Head and shoulders of a man in his early 60s in coat and tie, facing slightly to his right. He is balding and has a serious but slightly smiling expression.|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[Table Talk (Luther)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]], compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality | vauthors = Wing L | author-link1 = Lorna Wing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miles M |year=2005 |title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say? |title.= |publisher=Independent Living Institute |url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |accessdate=23 December 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131103210840/http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |archivedate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Houston R, Frith U |title=Autism in History: The Case of Hugh Blair of Borgue |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22089-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard|Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Wolff S | title = The history of autism | journal = Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 201–8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15365889 | doi = 10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning &quot;self&quot;), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kuhn R | title = Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology | journal = Hist Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–6 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15386868 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04044603 }} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans_title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanner1943&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 }} Reprinted in {{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title =  | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–36 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–3 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fombonne E | title = Modern views of autism | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–5 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20130526200951/http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/publications/archives/cjp/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp | archivedate = 2013-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author=[[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157–78 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-54957-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S | title = Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1320–7 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18297387 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L | title = A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119473 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}), or ''reflection coefficient'', derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot; (or reflected sunlight) in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white&quot;, is the [[diffuse reflection|diffuse reflectivity]] or reflecting power of a surface. It is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Its [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.

Albedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation, except for [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surfaces]], which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface, but albedo is very useful as a first approximation.

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and calculating [[reflectivity]] of surfaces in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] sustainable-rating systems for buildings. The average overall albedo of Earth, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, ISBN 0-7876-5486-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot;/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|200px|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;/&gt;).

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot;/&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth is covered by water—a so-called aquaplanet—the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot;/&gt;

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot;/&gt;

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong [[opposition effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater. The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt;

===Insolation effects ===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]]; high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rain forest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects [[climate]] and drives [[weather]]. All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos. Essentially, for the driving of weather, there are two types of albedo regions on Earth: Land and ocean. Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of [[air masses]], depending on latitude and therefore [[insolation]]: Warm and dry, which form over tropical and sub-tropical land masses; warm and wet, which form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans; cold and dry which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar land masses; and cold and wet, which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar oceans. Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures, and the masses develop into [[pressure systems]]. High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure, driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere, and south to north in the lower; however due to the spinning of Earth, the [[Coriolis effect]] further complicates flow and creates several weather/climate bands and the [[jet stream]]s.

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g. a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), Remote sensing of ice and snow. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland – Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic device]]s. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | url = | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | authorlink4 = J. M. Pearce | last2 = Abramase | first2 = A.L. | last3 = Andrews | first3 = R.W. | last4 = Pearce | first4 = J.

===Trees===
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Betts | first1 = RA | date = 2000 | title = Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6809| pages = 187–190 | doi = 10.1038/35041545 | pmid=11089969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | first1 =  et al. | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | url = | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | url = | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt;

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333)]]
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;uww&quot; /&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date=30 May 1991|bibcode=1992JGR....9714565C |author1=Cahalan |first1=Robert F. |volume=97 |pages=14565 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |doi=10.1029/92JD00799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per &lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) (&quot;The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e. for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)&quot;); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. (&quot;The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3.&quot;); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) (&quot;The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the &quot;efficacy&quot; of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human activities===
Human activities (e.g. deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]
'''A''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] ''a'' {{IPAc-en|'|eɪ}}, plural ''aes''{{refn|group=nb|''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is rendered ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, or a's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}) is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and [[vowel]] in the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/a&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter [[alpha]], from which it derives.  The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lower-case version can be written in two forms: the double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children. It is also found in [[italic type]].

==History==
The earliest certain ancestor of &quot;A&quot; is [[aleph]] (also called 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which, by consisting entirely of [[consonant]]s, is an [[abjad]] rather than a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the origin of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]&lt;ref name=Coll&gt;{{harvnb|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

In 1600 B.C.E., the Phoenician alphabet's letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] aleph.

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]]—the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter, and the sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]]—so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and gave it the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including English.

===Typographic variants===
[[File:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''.]]
During Roman times, there were many variations on the letter &quot;A&quot;. First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other &quot;permanent&quot; mediums. For perishable surfaces, what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes, a [[cursive]] style was used. Due to the &quot;perishable&quot; nature of the surfaces, these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental. This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.&lt;ref name=Americana&gt;{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the termination of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule appeared through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule, of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt;

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italics'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italics form used in most current [[handwriting]] consists of a circle and vertical stroke ({{Unicode|&quot;ɑ&quot;}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or &quot;script a&quot;. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{Unicode|&quot;a&quot;}}).&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

==Use in English==
In [[English orthography]], the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds: A by itself frequently denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/æ/}}) as in ''pad''; the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) as in ''father'', its original, Latin and Greek, sound;&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; a closer, further fronted sound as in &quot;hare&quot;, which developed as the sound progressed from &quot;father&quot; to &quot;ace&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[Great Vowel Shift]]; the more rounded form in &quot;water&quot; or its closely related cousin, found in &quot;was&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

The double &quot;a&quot; sequence is not a native English combination; however it occurs in some foreign words such as ''Aaron'' and ''aardvark''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after &quot;E&quot; and &quot;T&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be 'a', while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in other languages==
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, A denotes an open unrounded vowel: {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|ä]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|ɑ]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which A (and [[Á]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

==Use in mathematics, logic and science==
{{main|A (disambiguation)}}
In [[algebra]], the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities.

In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;

In [[logic]], A is used to signify the [[Categorical proposition|universal affirmative]].

In [[physics]], A is the [[SI]] unit symbol for [[Ampere]].

In phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPA|[a]}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|[ä]}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]] and {{IPA|[ɑ]}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[X-SAMPA]], [a] is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and [A] is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==Other uses==
{{main|A (disambiguation)}}
&quot;A&quot; is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; &quot;A grade&quot; for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|British Psychological Society|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A is a common symbol of school and basic phonetics in the US, along with [[B]] and [[C]].

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].

'''Alabama''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alabama.ogg|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|b|æ|m|ə}}) is a state located in the [[Southern United States|southeastern region]] of the United States. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|30th-most extensive]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|23rd-most populous]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]. At {{convert|1300|mi|km}}, Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;navwater&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commerce.alabama.gov/content/media/publications/Transportation/TransportationInAlabama.pdf |title=Transportation in Alabama |publisher=Alabama Development Office |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|White]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s, as it did not regularly reapportion the legislature from 1901 to 1961; urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary. Retrieved March 10, 2008 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans and poor whites were essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] altogether by the state constitution of 1901, a status that continued into the mid-1960s before being alleviated by federal legislation.

Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The power of the [[Solid South]] in Congress gained the establishment or expansion of multiple [[United States Armed Forces]] installations, which helped to bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid-20th century. The state economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008-2018 |work=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is nicknamed the ''[[Northern Flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;Heart of [[Dixie]]&quot; and the ''Cotton State''. The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[Longleaf Pine]], and the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[Camellia]]. The capital of Alabama is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The largest city by population is [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]],&lt;ref name=&quot;quickcensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=Alabama |work=QuickFacts |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has long been the most industrialized city, and largest city by total land area is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. The oldest city is [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], founded by French [[colonists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pelican&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomason|first=Michael|title=Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City|year=2001|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=0-8173-1065-7|pages=2–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Russell Cave Entrance RUCA9323.jpg|thumb|left|One of the entrances to [[Russell Cave National Monument|Russell Cave]] in Jackson County. Charcoal from indigenous camp fires in the cave has been dated as early as 6550 to 6145 BC.]]
The European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state originates from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=0-8173-0231-X |oclc=10724679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alabama language]], the word for an Alabama person is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Albàamo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=0-292-73077-2 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Alabama'' is believed to have come from the related [[Choctaw language]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rogers |first=William W.|author2=Robert D. Ward|author3=Leah R. Atkins|author4=Wayne Flynt |title=Alabama: the History of a Deep South State |year=1994 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=0-8173-0712-5 |oclc=28634588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |title=Alabama: The State Name |accessdate=August 2, 2007|work=All About Alabama |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070628215841/http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |archivedate= June 28, 2007  |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spelling of the word varies significantly among historical sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  The first usage appears in three accounts of the [[Hernando de Soto]] expedition of 1540 with [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] using ''Alibamo'', while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote ''Alibamu'' and ''Limamu'', respectively, in efforts to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the ''Alibamon,'' with French maps identifying the river as ''Rivière des Alibamons''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt;  Other spellings of the appellation have included ''Alibamu'', ''Alabamo'', ''Albama'', ''Alebamon'', ''Alibama'', ''Alibamou'', ''Alabamu'', ''Allibamou''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wills |first=Charles A. |title=A Historical Album of Alabama |year=1995 |publisher=The Millbrook Press |isbn=1-56294-591-2 |oclc=32242468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Griffith |first=Lucille |title=Alabama: A Documentary History to 1900|year=1972 |publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=0-8173-0371-5 |oclc=17530914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiss&quot;&gt;and possibly ''Alabahmu''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- source might be in print only--&gt; The use of state names derived from [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] is common; an estimated 27&amp;nbsp;states have names of Native American origin. {{Cite book|last=Weiss |first=Sonia |title= The Complete Idiot's Guide to Baby Names |year=1999 |publisher=Mcmillan USA |isbn=0-02-863367-9 |oclc=222611214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree on the meaning of the word. An 1842 article in the ''Jacksonville Republican'' proposed that it meant &quot;Here We Rest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of [[Alexander Beaufort Meek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; Experts in the [[Muskogean languages]] have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;

Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw ''alba'' (meaning &quot;plants&quot; or &quot;weeds&quot;) and ''amo'' (meaning &quot;to cut&quot;, &quot;to trim&quot;, or &quot;to gather&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swanton1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanton |first=John R. |authorlink=John R.

===Pre-European settlement===
[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes via the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;700) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title= Alabama |date= August 11, 2006 |work= The New York Times Almanac 2004 |accessdate= September 23, 2006 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20060926105134/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |archivedate= September 26, 2006  |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moundville Archaeological Site Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in Hale County. It was occupied by Native Americans of the [[Mississippian culture]] from 1000 to 1450 AD.]]

The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Welch |first= Paul D. |title= Moundville's Economy |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1991 |isbn= 0-8173-0512-2 |oclc= 21330955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Walthall |first= John A. |title= Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-8173-0552-1 |oclc= 26656858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after [[Cahokia]] in present-day [[Illinois]], which was the center of the culture.

Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the [[Cherokee]], an [[Iroquoian language]] people; and the [[Muskogean]]-speaking [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (''Alibamu''), [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], and [[Koasati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |title= Alabama Indian Tribes |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |year= 2006 |work= Indian Tribal Records |publisher= AccessGenealogy.com |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20061012073735/http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |archivedate= October 12, 2006  |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.

===European settlement===
With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama. The expedition of [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through [[Mabila]] and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the first European settlement in the region at [[Old Mobile Site|Old Mobile]] in 1702.&lt;ref name=&quot;US50&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |title= Alabama State History |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |publisher= theUS50.com |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20060825052401/http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |archivedate= August 25, 2006  |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was moved to the current site of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of [[La Louisiane]].&lt;ref name=alahisttmln/&gt;

After the French lost to the British in the [[Seven Years' War]], it became part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.&lt;ref name=alahisttmln&gt;{{cite web|title=Alabama History Timeline|url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html|publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annexed1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomason|first=Michael|title=Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City|year=2001|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=0-8173-1065-7|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Bassett, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest White settlers in the state outside Mobile.

What is now the counties of [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]] became part of [[Spanish West Florida]] in 1783, part of the independent [[Republic of West Florida]] in 1810, and was finally added to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the [[Yazoo lands]] beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the [[Province of Georgia]] from 1767 onwards. Following the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], it remained a part of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], although heavily disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cadle|first=Farris W|title=Georgia Land Surveying History and Law|year=1991|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Ga.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pickett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pickett|first=Albert James|title=History of Alabama and incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the earliest period|year=1851|publisher=Walker and James|location=Charleston|pages=408–428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798.

Prior to the admission of [[Mississippi]] as a state on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the [[Alabama Territory]]. The Alabama Territory was created by the [[United States Congress]] on March 3, 1817.

The U.S. Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of state government was moved to [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahaba]] in [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huntsville |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2498 |work=The Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher= Alabama Humanities Foundation |accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, the population had increased to a total of 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080 were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were [[free people of color]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adahtmln&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html |title=Alabama History Timeline |work=Alabama Department of Archives and History |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].  After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the [[Confederate States of America]]. The Confederacy's capital was initially located at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].  Alabama was heavily [[Alabama in the American Civil War|involved in the American Civil War]].  Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.

A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s battalion in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]].  The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. This led to them being greeted with &quot;Yellowhammer&quot;, and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.state.al.us/emblems/st_bird.html Official Symbols and Emblems of Alabama, State Bird of Alabama, Yellowhammer].

From 1867 to 1874, with most White citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: [[Jeremiah Haralson]], [[Benjamin S. Turner]], and [[James T. Rapier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamamoments.alabama.gov/sec24.html |title=Reconstruction in Alabama: A Quick Summary |work=Alabama Moments in American History |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], state legislators ratified a [[Constitution of Alabama|new state constitution]] in 1868 that created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; Organized [[insurgent]], resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original [[Ku Klux Klan]], these included the Pale Faces, [[Knights of the White Camellia]], [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], and the [[White League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt;

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; and the legislature passed the [[Blaine Amendment]], prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |title=A Blaine Amendment Update (July 00) |publisher=Schoolreport.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110716014339/http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |archivedate= July 16, 2011  |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, legislation was approved that called for [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classroomhelp.com/till/jimcrowlaws/jimcrowalabama.html |title=Jim Crow Laws in Alabama |work=Emmett Till, It All Began with a Whistle |publisher=Classroomhelp |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt; After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more [[Jim Crow laws]] at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.

===20th century===
[[File:Birmingham Alabama skyline 1915.jpg|thumb|left|The developing skyline of Birmingham in 1915]]

The new 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]] included provisions for voter registration that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser. ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were [[literate]]. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt;

While the planter class had persuaded poor Whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt;  By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 Whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.

The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal, as it had been prohibited in 1867. Into the 1950s, the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |work= Southern Spaces Internet Journal |publisher= Emory University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS|work=&quot;National Register Information System&quot; |url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64500011.pdf |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Sinai School Autauga County July 2011 1.jpg|thumb|The former [[Mount Sinai School]] in rural Autauga County, completed in 1919. It was one of the 387 [[Rosenwald Schools]] built in the state.]]

Beginning in 1913, the first 80 [[Rosenwald School]]s were built in Alabama for African-American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. Several of the [[The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings Multiple Property Submission|surviving school buildings]] in the state are now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;/&gt;

Continued racial discrimination and [[lynchings]], agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South. Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;Historical Populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.

At the same time, many rural people, both White and African American, migrated to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called &quot;The Magic City&quot;. By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the state's population. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s, following a lawsuit and court order to establish the principle of apportionment as &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter -steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial &quot;[[gerrymandering]]&quot; violated the Constitution. In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot;&gt;James Blacksher, Edward Still, Nick Quinton, Cullen Brown and Royal Dumas. [http://www.protectcivilrights.org/pdf/voting/AlabamaVRA.pdf ''Voting Rights in Alabama (1982-2006)''], Renew the VRA.org, July 2006, from discussion in Peyton McCrary, Jerome A. Gray, Edward Still, and Huey L. Perry, &quot;Alabama&quot; in ''Quiet Revolution in the South'', pp. 38-52, Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, eds. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt;  Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomason2&quot;&gt;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : The New History of Alabama's First City'', pages 213–217. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.

One result was that [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

A class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in [[Lowndes County, Alabama]] challenged the state legislature's lack of redistricting for congressional seats. In 1962 ''[[White v. Crook]]'', Judge [[Frank M. Johnson]] ordered the state to redistrict. United States Supreme Court cases of ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964) ruled that the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot; needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as Alabama had used for its senate.

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt; Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

[[File:SelmaHeschelMarch.jpg|thumb|left|The third [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery march]] in 1965, one of the seminal events of the civil rights movement in Alabama.]]
African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], including legal challenges. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor [[George Wallace]], Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for [[desegregation]].The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955–56), [[Freedom Rides]] in 1961, and 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archivedate= October 21, 2010  |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] by the U.S. Congress.

Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but [[Jim Crow]] customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070221054512/http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archivedate= February 21, 2007 |title= Voting Rights |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |date= January 9, 2002 |work= Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher= U.S.Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite recommendations of a 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission, the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties. There is very limited home rule, but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies. This both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues.
 
Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]],'' challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cites and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;cum&quot;&gt;[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 &quot;Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)&quot;/&quot;Proportional Voting in Alabama&quot;], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North Alabama]] region is mostly mountainous, with the [[Tennessee River]] cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NetState&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/al_geography.htm |title= The Geography of Alabama |work=Geography of the States |publisher=NetState.com |date= August 11, 2006 |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20060917172224/http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/al_geography.htm |archivedate= September 17, 2006 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is bordered by the states of [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, Florida to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}
[[File:Birmingham city hall alabama 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Snowfall outside Birmingham City Hall in February 2010.]]

The state is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') under the [[Humid temperate climate|Koppen Climate Classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |title=Encyclopedia of Alabama: Climate |date=August 17, 2007 |publisher=University of Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature is 64&amp;nbsp;°F (18&amp;nbsp;°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |title=Alabama Climate |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&amp;nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorms]]. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]]; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 2004-2013]. NLSI. Retrieved April 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama, along with [[Oklahoma]], has the most reported [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5 tornadoes]] of any state, according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes LIST: States with the most F5/EF5 tornadoes since 1950; Ohio high on list]. Retrieved April 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Several long-tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state, even surpassing Texas which has a much larger area within [[Tornado Alley]]. The state suffered tremendous damage in the [[Super Outbreak]] of April 1974, and the [[April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak]]. The outbreak in April 2011 produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Mike |title=April 27's record tally: 62 tornadoes in Alabama |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |work= |publisher=al.com |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phil Campbell tornado damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage in [[Phil Campbell, Alabama|Phil Campbell]] following the statewide [[April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak|April 27, 2011 tornado outbreak]].]]
The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the southeastern U.S., with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|°F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925 in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]]. The record low of {{convert|-27|°F}} occurred on January 30, 1966 in [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |title=Record high and low temperatures for all 50 states |work=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=accuracyproject.org |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US01&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR2&amp;-ds_name=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization.&lt;ref name=&quot;census-ancestries&quot;&gt;[[Media:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.jpg|Census 2000 Map – Top U.S. Ancestries by County]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.361–368&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the [[Alabama Indian Affairs Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aiac&quot;&gt;[http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx &quot;Alabama Indian Affairs Commission&quot;], State of Alabama, accessed September 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.

The state has [[State recognized tribes in the United States|officially recognized]] nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the American Southeast. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |title=AIAC Bylaws |work=Alabama Indian Affairs Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Poarch Band of Creek Indians]] (who also have federal recognition),
* [[MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians]],
* Star Clan of [[Muscogee Creek people|Muscogee Creeks]],
* Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama,
* [[Cherokee Tribe of Northeast Alabama]],
* Cher-O-Creek Intra Tribal Indians,
* ''Ma-Chis'' Lower Creek Indian Tribe,
* ''Piqua'' [[Shawnee]] Tribe, and
* ''Ani-Yun-Wiya'' Nation.

The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiac.state.al.us/ProcIndianHeritageDay.aspx &quot;American Indian Heritage Day&quot;, Alabama Indian Affairs Commission, 2000, accessed 28 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
96.1% of all Alabama residents five years old or older spoke only English at home in 2000, a minor decrease from  97.1% in 1990. Alabama English is predominantly [[Southern American English|Southern]],&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data.com&quot;&gt;http://www.city-data.com/states/Alabama-Languages.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from [[Tennessee]]. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of 'bird.' In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland 'arm' and 'barb' rhyming with 'form' and 'orb.' Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (clingstone), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons).&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data.com&quot;/&gt;

Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]], a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html US Church attendance]&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. {{as of|2010}}, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[The United Methodist Church]], and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &amp;#124; State membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the [[United Methodist Church]] with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the [[Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The [[Assemblies of God]] had almost 60,000 members, the [[Churches of Christ]] had nearly 120,000 members. The [[Presbyterian church]]es, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 ([[Presbyterian Church in America|PCA]]-28,009 members in 108 congregations, [[PC(USA)]]-26,247 members in 147 congregations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]]-6,000 members in 59 congregations, the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America]]-5,000 members and 50 congreagtions plus the [[Edgewater Presbyterian Church|EPC]] and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations).&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/01_2000.asp |title=State Membership Reports |year= 2000 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |publisher= thearda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first community of adherents of the [[Baha'i Faith]] in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy who moved from Chicago to [[Fairhope]] to participate in the growth of Fairhope as a utopian community.  The first community of Baha'is in Alabama was racially integrated from the beginning due to the Faith's principles.  Today there is an exhibit honoring Dealy in [[Haifa]], Israel at the world center of the [[Baha'i Faith]].  Baha'i Centers in Alabama exist in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and [[Florence, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shoalsbahais.com/About-Us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{See also|Alabama locations by per capita income}}

The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and [[fabrication (metal)|fabrication]]. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2330 |title=Food Production in Alabama |last1=Ijaz |first1=Ahmad |last2=Addy |first2=Samuel N. |date=July 6, 2009 |work=The Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher=Auburn University |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;/&gt;

According to the U.S. [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the 2008 total [[gross state product]] was $170&amp;nbsp;billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama's 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year.

==Law and government==

===State government===
[[File:Alabama Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol Building]] in Montgomery, completed in 1851]]
{{Main|Government of Alabama}}

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the [[Alabama Constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lockette, [http://www.annistonstar.com/article_c928bd51-fbf1-5056-a30c-1bf4b19eb012.html?mode=jqm Is the Alabama Constitution the longest constitution in the world?Truth Rating: 4 out of 5], ''Anniston Star''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/us/alabama-simmers-before-vote-on-its-constitutions-racist-language.html?pagewanted=all Alabama Simmers Before Vote on Its Constitution's Racist Language], ''New York Times'', October 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16443-2004Nov27?language=printer |last= Roig-Franzia |first= Manuel |title= Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds |work=The Washington Post |date= November 28, 2004 |accessdate= September 22, 2006}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |title= Constitution of Alabama – 1901 |work= The Alabama Legislative Information System |accessdate= September 22, 2006 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20060923081542/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |archivedate= September 23, 2006  |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archivedate= September 15, 2010  |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics suggest that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.

[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Alabama Supreme Court]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]

Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already had in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, it ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems. At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.

The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert J. Bentley|Robert Bentley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is Republican [[Kay Ivey]].

The [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. Alabama uses partisan elections to choose judges, and since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;&gt;[http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL Judicial Selection in the States: Alabama], American Judicature Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[chief justice]] of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Roy Moore]]. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate [[appellate court]]s, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four [[trial court]]s: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;/&gt;

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers take office the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html|title= Alabama's Legislative Process |first= McDowell |last= Lee|year= 2009|publisher= State of Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxes===
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent [[State income tax|personal income tax]], depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]] from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the [[standard deduction]]. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]] (Social Security and Medicare tax).

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|date=20070520231150 |url=http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sl_sales.html |title=Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes}}. taxadmin.org, July 2004, Retrieved December 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revenue.alabama.gov/publications/business-taxes/sales/Sales_Tax--Sales_Tax_Brochure.pdf Sales Tax Brochure]. State of Alabama.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&amp;nbsp;million.

===County and Local governments===
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}
{{see also|List of counties in Alabama}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. The cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems, and the state legislators are buried in local county issues.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;/&gt; Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot;. Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties.

&quot;The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P. Brewer, &quot;Home Rule&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama'', 2007, accessed 3 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2011, Jefferson County, which was $4 billion in debt at the time, declared bankruptcy. This is the second-largest [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9]] (municipal) bankruptcy in the United States, after the [[Detroit bankruptcy]]. Jefferson County emerged from bankruptcy in December 2013 following the approval of a bankruptcy plan by the [[United States bankruptcy court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama|Northern District of Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al.com/jeffco/ Jefferson County bankruptcy] articles from the ''Huntsville Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20131204/NEWS/131209934 Jefferson County emerges from bankruptcy], December 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Sigo, [http://www.bondbuyer.com/issues/123_1/bankruptcy-over-but-jefferson-county-ala-will-remain-in-the-news-1058616-1.html &quot;Bankruptcy Over, But Jefferson County, Ala., Will Remain in the News&quot;], ''Bond Buyer'', December 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]], meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The [[Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board]] controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. Twenty-five of the 67 counties are &quot;[[Dry county|dry counties]]&quot; which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcboard.alabama.gov/%28S%28s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb%29%29/wet_dry_map.aspx Wet-Dry Map], Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
[[File:Robert Bentley.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Robert J. Bentley]], governor since January 17, 2011]]
[[File:Kay Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Kay Ivey]], lieutenant governor]]

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African-American vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.

After 1890, a coalition of White politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised African Americans also excluded many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when racist Whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Democrat [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican Governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years, after a nearly complete realignment of political parties. The party is dominated by white conservatives who used to belong to the Democratic Party.

===Elections===
{{main|Elections in Alabama}}

====State elections====
With the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of African Americans]] in 1901, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late-20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |work=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title= Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html| archivedate= August 2, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy, Press-Register |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher= al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110513135614/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html| archivedate= May 13, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[freedmen]] who had gained the franchise. The two GOP Lt. Governors were Steve Windom (1999-2003) and the current Lt. Governor, [[Kay Ivey]], who was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.

====Local elections====
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in many local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results – Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results – Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan, [[at-large]] races, and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts. The current split is 42 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], 24 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]], and one Independent (Choctaw).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011-2015 Alabama Sheriffs|url=http://alabamasheriffs.com/uploads/20130409/85e6648587de92a5a9886ebc22a20009.pdf|publisher=Alabama Sheriffs Association|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/?PageID=131&amp;IsNav=true |title=Association |publisher=Alabama Sheriffs |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs; and five [[Counties of Alabama|Alabama counties]] with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/Image.aspx?ImageID=11481&amp;Title=2007-2011+Alabama+Sheriffs |title=2007–2011 Alabama Sheriffs |publisher=Alabamasheriffs.com |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012}}, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in [[Morgan County, Alabama]], and nine African-American sheriffs.&lt;ref&gt;Alabama Sheriffs Association&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal elections====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]], both Republicans. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.

In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Bradley Byrne]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Morris J. Brooks]], [[Martha Roby]], and [[Gary Palmer]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]].

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Alabama}}

===Primary and secondary education===
[[File:Vestavia Hills High School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vestavia Hills High School]] in the suburbs of Birmingham]]

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |title= Alabama Education Quick Facts 2012-13 |accessdate =April 29, 2014 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, over 82&amp;nbsp;percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate—75%—is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics].

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are three medical schools ([[University of Alabama School of Medicine]], [[University of South Alabama]] and [[Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine]]), two veterinary colleges ([[Auburn University]] and [[Tuskegee University]]), a dental school ([[University of Alabama School of Dentistry]]), an optometry college ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]), two pharmacy schools ([[Auburn University]] and [[Samford University]]), and five law schools ([[University of Alabama School of Law]], [[Birmingham School of Law]], [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Miles Law School]], and the [[Thomas Goode Jones School of Law]]). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the [[Alabama Commission on Higher Education]] and the [[Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education]]. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ache&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work= Alabama Commission on Higher Education |title= Directory of Alabama Colleges and Universities |url= http://www.ache.alabama.gov/Colleges&amp;Universities/Directory.htm |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===
{{Main|Aviation in Alabama}}

Major airports with sustained commercial operations in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), and [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals – Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] (MSL).

===Rail===
For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the [[Crescent (train)|Crescent]], a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa.

===Roads===
Alabama has five major interstate roads that cross the state: [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate&amp;nbsp;65]] (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59 in Alabama|I-59]] travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards Atlanta; [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|I-85]] originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. Another interstate, [[Interstate 22 in Alabama|I-22]], is currently under construction. When completed, it will connect Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Decatur and Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685|I-685]], will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]]. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, [[Interstate 222|I-222]] has been proposed, as well.

Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route&amp;nbsp;11]] (US-11), [[U.S. Route 29 in Alabama|US-29]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US-31]], [[U.S. Route 43 in Alabama|US-43]], [[U.S. Route 45 in Alabama|US-45]], [[U.S. Route 72 in Alabama|US-72]], [[U.S. Route 78 in Alabama|US-78]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|US-80]], [[U.S. Route 82 in Alabama|US-82]], [[U.S. Route 84 in Alabama|US-84]], [[U.S. Route 90 in Alabama|US-90]], [[U.S. Route 98 in Alabama|US-98]], [[U.S. Route 231 in Alabama|US-231]], [[U.S. Route 278 in Alabama|US-278]], [[U.S. Route 280 in Alabama|US-280]], [[U.S. Route 331 in Alabama|US-331]], [[U.S. Route 411 in Alabama|US-411]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]].

There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]; Tuscaloosa Bypass in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]; Emerald Mountain Expressway in [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]]; and Beach Express in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]].

===Ports===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]]. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonstraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Table 1086.

[[File:Achilles departure Eretria Painter CdM Paris 851.jpg|thumb|350px|Achilles and the [[Nereid]] Cymothoe: Attic red-figure [[kantharos]] from [[Volci]] ([[Cabinet des Médailles]], Bibliothèque nationale, Paris)]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀχιλλεύς}}, ''Akhilleus'', {{IPA-el|akʰilːéu̯s|pron}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] hero of the [[Trojan War]] and the central character and greatest warrior of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. His mother was the nymph [[Thetis]], and his father, [[Peleus]], was the king of the [[Myrmidons]].

Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term ''[[Achilles' heel]]'' has come to mean a person's point of weakness.

== Etymology ==
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{lang|grc|ἄχος}} (''akhos'') &quot;grief&quot; and {{lang|grc|λαός}} (''laos'') &quot;a people, tribe, nation.&quot; In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of κλέος ''kleos'' (&quot;glory&quot;, usually glory in war).

''Laos'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]],{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} following Leonard Palmer, to mean &quot;a corps of soldiers&quot;, a [[muster (military)|muster]]. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin of the name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 183–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search?patt=*AXIL&amp;first=250 Epigraphical database] gives 476 matches for Ἀχιλ-.The earliest ones: [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=27810&amp;bookid=6&amp;region=2&amp;subregion=1 Corinth 7th c. BC],[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=238250&amp;bookid=118&amp;region=3&amp;subregion=7 Delphi 530 BC], Attica and Elis 5th c. BC.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (''Achilleía'') attested in Attica in the 4th century BC ([[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]] II² 1617) and, in the form ''Achillia'', on a [[Female gladiator#Halicarnassus|stele in Halicarnassus]] as the name of a female gladiator fighting an &quot;Amazon&quot;.

== Birth ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 181.jpg|thumb|''Thetis Dipping the Infant Achilles into the River Styx'' (ca. 1625), [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

Achilles was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755–768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34–37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26–47; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' (ii.15)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in ''[[Argonautica]]'' (iv.760) Zeus' sister and wife [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god [[Nereus]], was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.&lt;!--the following psychological interpretation has no counterpart in the myths:&quot;Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. So Hera recommended that she marry [[Peleus]], as he was as near to a mortal as she was ever going to get.&quot;--&gt;

According to the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Burgess| first = Jonathan S.| title = The Death and Afterlife of Achilles| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ko_YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9| accessdate = 5 February 2010| year = 2009| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| location = Baltimore| isbn = 0-8018-9029-2| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Achilles heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]]). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood&quot;.

Also, in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which we can find description of the hero's death, ''[[Cypria]]'' (unknown author), ''[[Aithiopis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], ''[[Little Iliad]]'' by Lesche of Mytilene, ''[[Iliou persis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87–89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830-32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achilles in the Trojan War ==
[[File:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]]]

The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
:{{lang|grc|μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος}}
:{{lang|grc|οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν,}}

:Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,
:the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]].

Achilles' consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.

According to the ''Iliad'', Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[Myrmidons]] (Book 2). He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16).

=== Telephus ===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos]], where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Troilus ===
According to the ''[[Cypria]]'' (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of [[Aeneas]], sacked neighboring cities and killed [[Troilus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister [[Polyxena]], and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth&amp;nbsp;– who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html &quot;Zeus Be Nice Now&quot;] in ''London Review of Books;'' 19 July 2007, access date 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the [[First Vatican Mythographer]] claimed, Troy would have been invincible.

=== Achilles in the ''Iliad'' ===
{{main|Iliad}}
[[File:AmbrosianIliadPict47Achilles.jpg|thumb|Achilles sacrificing to [[Zeus]], from the [[Ambrosian Iliad]], a 5th-century illuminated manuscript]]

Homer's ''Iliad'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath is the central theme of the poem. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so and Calchas declares Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]] be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis),&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334–343.&lt;/ref&gt; with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sent [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]], to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him, and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle wearing Achilles' armor, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in front of the Gates of [[Troy]] (from a [[panoramic]] [[fresco]] on the upper level of the main hall of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]).]]

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death and holds many funeral games in his honor. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armor includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]] who becomes angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991, p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot during Patroclus' funeral games.

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]], Hector's father, [[Priam]], goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral. The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

=== Penthesilea ===
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior queen [[Penthesilea]], but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.

=== Memnon, and the fall of Achilles ===
[[File:Achilles thniskon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|Achilles dying in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]]]

Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son [[Antilochus]]. When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]] slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad'''s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century B.C. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

{{anchor|Fatalwound}}
The death of Achilles, as predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, was brought about by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.

[[File:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles: [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure ''[[lekythos]]'', ca. 510 BC, from Sicily ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich)]]
All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]].

Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.

Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton E. Mythology, New York: Penguin Books; 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris was later killed by [[Philoctetes]] using the enormous bow of [[Heracles]].

=== Fate of Achilles' armor ===
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax (mythology)|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' 1973.144.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was being shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing (1980:65–85) esp. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achilles, Ajax and a game of ''petteia''===

Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] were playing a [[board game]] (''petteia'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html &quot;Petteia&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html &quot;Greek Board Games&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html &quot;Latrunculi&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioannis Kakridis|Kakridis, I.]] (1988).

== Achilles and Patroclus ==
{{main|Achilles and Patroclus}}

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. [[Homer]] does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers.&lt;ref name= &quot;Fox 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Tribal Imagination: Civilization and the Savage Mind |last= Fox |first= Robin |year= 2011 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674060944 |quote= There is certainly no evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers. |page= 223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Alexander the Great : the story of an ancient life|last= Martin |first= Thomas R |year= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0521148448 |quote= The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers.

(That came from later authors.) If Alexander and Hephaestion did have a sexual relationship, it would have been transgressive by majority Greek standards... |pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin 2012&quot; /&gt; Commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'']]. In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673–4.&lt;/ref&gt; But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and homosexual,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.

[[File:Achilles killing the Amazon Queen Penthesilea.jpg|thumb|right|Penthesilea brought her Amazon warriors to help the Trojans defend their city but was killed in combat with Achilles. Here, Achilles looms above her as she sinks to the ground.]]
There was an archaic [[heroic cult]] of Achilles on the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|White Island, ''Leuce'']], in the [[Black Sea]] off the modern coasts of [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]], with a temple and an [[oracle]] which survived into the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Hedreen, &quot;The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine&quot; ''Hesperia'' '''60'''.3 (July 1991), pp. 313–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lost epic '' [[Aithiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad'' attributed to [[Arctinus|Arktinus of Miletos]], Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a [[tumulus]] for him and celebrated funeral games.

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''&lt;ref&gt;IV.27.1&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident (''Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara''), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from [[Peuce]] by the [[Danube Delta]], and the temple there. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;III.19.11&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.

[[Pomponius Mela]] tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister.&lt;ref&gt;''De situ orbis'', II, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbis descriptio'', v. 541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' gives the following details: &quot;It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships&quot;. (quoted in Densuşianu)

The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the [[Black Sea|Pontic Sea]] but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.

Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as ''Pontarches'' the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia ([[Stephanus Byzantinus]]), Achilleios in Laconia ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III.25,4) [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of [[Aquileia]] and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia (&quot;Achileii&quot;), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&quot;

Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the [[Delphi|Delphic Pythia]] sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.

=== Worship of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu ===
In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of [[Corfu]] Greece, Empress of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]] also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to [[platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]]. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: ''[[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]'' (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the [[Trojan war]].

== Other stories ==
[[File:Achilles in Corfu.jpg|thumb|left|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in Corfu. He gazes northward toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ i.e. Achilles]]
{{main|Achilles on Skyros}}

Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]]. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], ''Imagines'' i; Scholiast on Homer's Iliad, xix. 326; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 13.162ff., Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' iii. 13. 8, [[Statius]], [[Achilleid]], ii. 167ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In book 11 of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical &quot;White Island&quot; which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.

The kings of the [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (Amazon)|Helene]]. Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades&amp;nbsp;– as Hera promised Thetis in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]''. In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive [[Briseis]].

== Achilles in Greek tragedy ==
{{main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}

The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'', a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radt. ''Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149–157a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;&gt;Latacz 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achilles in Greek philosophy ==
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centered one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;[[Epithets in Homer#Individuals|swift-footed]]&quot; [[Zeno's paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

== Achilles in Roman and medieval literature ==
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;/&gt; [[Vergil]] refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'', 2.29; 1.30; 3.87&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Horace]] portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'', 4.6.17–20&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, such as [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]] and in [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]'s ''[[Roman de Troie]]'' and [[Guido delle Colonne]]'s ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the [[Matter of Troy]] until the 17th century.

'''Abraham Lincoln''' {{IPAc-en|audio=Lincoln.ogg|ˈ|eɪ|b|r|ə|h|æ|m|_|ˈ|l|I|ŋ|k|ən}} (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|16th President of the United States]], serving from March 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination in April 1865]]. Lincoln led the United States through its [[American Civil War|Civil War]]—its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional and political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Pencak|title=Encyclopedia of the Veteran in America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yyvmcMsNnB4C&amp;pg=PA222|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=978-0-313-08759-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Finkelman|author2=Stephen E. Gottlieb|title=Toward a Usable Past: Liberty Under State Constitutions|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xJuXT1sVhFcC&amp;pg=PA388|year=2009|publisher=U of Georgia Press|page=388|isbn=978-0-8203-3496-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, he preserved the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.

Lincoln grew up on the [[American frontier|western frontier]] in [[Kentucky]] and [[Indiana]]. Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in [[Illinois]], a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party leader]], and a member of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], where he served from 1834 to 1846. Elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, tariffs, and railroads. Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress, and his opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]] was unpopular among Illinois voters, Lincoln returned to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which had a statewide majority in Illinois. In 1858, while taking part in a [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|series of highly publicized debates]] with his opponent and rival, Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas.

In 1860 Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state. With very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]]. His election prompted seven southern slave states to form the [[Confederate States of America]] before he was sworn into office. No compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession.

After the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]] on April 12, 1861, the North enthusiastically rallied behind the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war. His primary goal was to reunite the nation. He suspended [[habeas corpus]], leading to the controversial [[ex parte Merryman]] decision. Lincoln averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the [[Trent Affair]] in late 1861. His complex moves toward ending slavery centered on the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863. Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery, and helped push through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He also made major decisions on Union war strategy; for example: a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade; moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee; and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system. Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.

An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to &quot;[[War Democrats]]&quot; (those who supported the North against the South), and managed his own re-election campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats, who called for more compromise, anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Politically, Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory, and by carefully planned political patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), pp. 65–87.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Gettysburg Address]] of 1863 became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general [[Robert E. Lee]], Lincoln was assassinated by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Confederate sympathizer.

Lincoln has been consistently [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|ranked]] both by scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranking Our Presidents&quot;&gt;[http://history-world.org/pres.pdf &quot;Ranking Our Presidents&quot;].

==Family and childhood==

===Early life and family ancestry===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln|Thomas]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a one-room log cabin on the [[Sinking Spring Farm]] in [[Hardin County, Kentucky|Hardin County]], Kentucky&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue County]]). He is a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], who migrated from [[Norfolk]], England to [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], Massachusetts, in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's western migration, which passed through [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis A.

Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Shipley Hanks, and was born in what is now [[Mineral County, West Virginia|Mineral County]], West Virginia, then part of Virginia. The identity of Lincoln's maternal grandfather is unclear.&lt;ref name=Bartelt79&gt;{{cite book|author=William E.

Lucy Hanks migrated to Kentucky with her daughter, Nancy. The two women resided with relatives in Washington County, Kentucky.&lt;ref name=Bartelt79/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 6 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]], following their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They became the parents of three children: Sarah, born on February 10, 1807; Abraham, on February 12, 1809; and another son, Thomas, who died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lincoln bought or leased several farms in Kentucky, including the Sinking Spring farm, where Abraham was born; however, a land title dispute soon forced the Lincolns to move.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warren12&gt;Warren, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811 the family relocated eight miles north, to [[Knob Creek Farm]], where Thomas acquired title to {{convert|230| acre|ha}} of land. In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm.&lt;ref name=Warren12/&gt; Of the 816.5 acres that Thomas held in Kentucky, he lost all but {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of his land in court disputes over property titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandberg-20&quot;/&gt; Frustrated over the lack of security provided by Kentucky courts, Thomas sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814, and began planning a move to [[Indiana]], where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure.&lt;ref name=Warren13&gt;Warren, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 the family moved north across the [[Ohio River]] to [[Indiana]], a free, non-slaveholding territory, where they settled in an &quot;unbroken forest&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; in Hurricane Township, [[Perry County, Indiana#History|Perry County]]. (Their land in southern Indiana became part of [[Spencer County, Indiana]], when the county was established in 1818.)&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 16 and 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 3, 5, and 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The farm is preserved as part of the [[Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial]]. In 1860 Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot;; but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandberg-20&quot;&gt;Sandburg (1926), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; During the family's years in Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 34 and 156.&lt;/ref&gt; He owned farms, several town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year of the family's arrival in Indiana, Thomas claimed title to {{convert|160|acre|ha}} of Indiana land. Despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} of land in what became known as the Little Pigeon Creek community in Spencer County.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 24 and 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the family's move to Illinois in 1830, Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 25 and 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several significant family events took place during Lincoln's youth in Indiana. On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died of [[milk sickness]], leaving eleven-year-old [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]] in charge of a household that included her father, nine-year-old Abraham, and Dennis Hanks, Nancy's nineteen-year-old orphaned cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 22–23, and 77.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2, 1819, Lincoln's father married  [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Bush Johnston]], a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 23 and 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham became very close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as &quot;Mother&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who knew Lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister Sarah's death on January 20, 1828, while giving birth to a [[stillborn]] son.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 20, 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his &quot;reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author=William Lee Miller| title = Lincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography | publisher =Random House/Vintage Books | series = | volume = | edition =Vintage Books | year =2002 | location =New York | page =31 | url =  | isbn =0-375-40158-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 25, 31, and 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and must have done it to avoid manual labor. His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy &quot;physical labor&quot;, but loved to read.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent, the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 10 and 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=James H.

As he grew into his teens, Lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household. He also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty-one.&lt;ref name=&quot;donald-1996-p30-33&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham became an adept as using an axe. Tall for his age, Lincoln was also strong and athletic.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt; He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as &quot;the Clary's Grove boys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, the Lincoln family moved west to Illinois, a non-slaveholding state. They settled on a site in [[Macon County, Illinois]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 41 and 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians disagree on who initiated the move.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; After the family relocated to Illinois, Abraham became increasingly distant from his father,&lt;ref name=Bartelt71&gt;Bartelt, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; in part because of his father's lack of education, and occasionally lent him money.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 28 and 152.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, as Thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own.&lt;ref name=Oates15-17&gt;{{cite book | author=Stephen B.

Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996 pp. 67&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 67–69; Thomas (2008), pp. 56–57, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996 pp. 67&quot;/&gt;

In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; They met in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], Illinois, in December 1839&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandburg4648&quot;&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; and were engaged the following December.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandburg4648&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister.&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in 1843 and [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie) in 1846. Lincoln &quot;was remarkably fond of children&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis. [[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 179–181, 476.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. His last descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Emerson|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Steers, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham Lincoln suffered from &quot;[[History of depression|melancholy]],&quot; a condition which now is referred to as [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanticoct2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression|title=Lincoln's Great Depression|first=Joshua Wolf|last=Shenk|date=October 2005|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a4fProj |archivedate=October 20, 2011|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (1995), pp. 440–447.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.

[[File:Lincoln protecting Potawatomi.jpg|thumb|150px|Lincoln depicted protecting a Native American from his own men in a scene often related about Lincoln's service during the [[Black Hawk War]].]]

In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth J. Winkle|title=The Young Eagle: The Rise of Abraham Lincoln|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JcEVAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77|year=2001|publisher=Taylor |pages=72–79|isbn=9781461734369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural [[raconteur]] in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=fuTY3mxs9awC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20Salem%20debating%20club%22&amp;f=false pp. 40–42].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln/Volume 3/The Improvement of Sangamon River]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the [[Black Hawk War]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkle, pp. 86–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|0}},&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (2002), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; he was tall and &quot;strong enough to intimidate any rival&quot;. At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his &quot;neck and the seat of his trousers&quot; and threw him.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.&lt;ref&gt;Winkle, pp. 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: &quot;I studied with nobody&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1836,&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under [[John T. Stuart]], Mary Todd's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 71, 79, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with [[Stephen T. Logan]] from 1841 until 1844.  Then Lincoln began [[Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices State Historic Site|his practice]] with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], whom Lincoln thought &quot;a studious young man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1948), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful on his second run for office, Lincoln served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the construction of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], which he remained involved with later as a Canal Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/abraham-lincoln-in-depth/abraham-lincoln-and-internal-improvements/#imc&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his &quot;free soil&quot; stance of opposing both slavery and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, &quot;[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; His stance closely followed [[Henry Clay]] in supporting the [[American Colonization Society]] program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in [[Liberia]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), pp. 17–19, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressman Lincoln==
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Nicholas Shepherd, 1846-crop.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Middle aged clean shaven Lincoln from the hips up.|Lincoln in his late 30s as a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. Photo taken by one of Lincoln's law students around 1846.]]
From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be, &quot;an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 137–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman [[Joshua R. Giddings]], wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the [[Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 54; Foner (2010), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he attributed to [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler (2006), pp. 181–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded ''our territory'' and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our ''own soil''{{-&quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler1pp199—202&quot;&gt;Basler (1946), pp. 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler1pp199—202&quot;/&gt;

Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovern, p. 33&quot;&gt;McGovern, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1946), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerSchamel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/|title=Lincoln's Spot Resolutions|publisher=National Archives|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a5gtE9P|archivedate=October 20, 2011|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the [[General Land Office]], but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, [[Justin Butterfield]], considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an &quot;old fossil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the [[Oregon Territory]]. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prairie lawyer==
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling &quot;every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 105–106, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a [[Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company|landmark case]] involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/bridge.html Bridging the Mississippi].

Retrieved on 2013-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, he received [[Abraham Lincoln's patent|a patent for a flotation device]] for the movement of boats in shallow water.

In 1851, he represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald p. 155&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dirck (2007), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald p. 155&quot;/&gt; Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 155–156, 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald150151&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald150151&quot;/&gt;

Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald150151&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1935), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery and a &quot;House Divided&quot;===
{{further|Slave and free states|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been generally outlawed in the northern states, including Illinois, whose original 1818 Constitution forbade slavery, as required by the [[Northwest Ordinance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Peculiar Institution|url=http://publications.newberry.org/lincoln/exhibits/show/alwayshatedslavery/peculiarinstitution|publisher=Newberry Library and Chicago History Museum|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62dB0ccYV|archivedate=October 22, 2011|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln disapproved of slavery, and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Speaks Out|url=http://publications.newberry.org/lincoln/exhibits/show/alwayshatedslavery/speaksout|publisher=Newberry Library and Chicago History Museum|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62dBlWFGi|archivedate=October 22, 2011|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting [[Missouri Compromise]] (1820). Senior Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois had incorporated [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] into the Act. Douglas' provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory, rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Foner]] (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:DredScott.jpg|alt=Painting|thumb|upright|A portrait of [[Dred Scott]]. Lincoln denounced the Supreme Court decision in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery.]]

On October 16, 1854, in his &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]&quot;, Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 148–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice,&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; he said the Kansas Act had a &quot;''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]], who defeated opponent [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 205–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wecyqmIs6voC&amp;pg=PA16#v=snippet&amp;q=%22I%20think%20I%20am%20a%20Whig%22&amp;f=false |title=Lincoln Looks West: From the Mississippi to the Pacific |editor=Richard W. Etulain|&lt;!-- author2=Robert W. Johannsen --&gt;|page=16|publisher=Southern Illinois University |date= March 5, 2010|accessdate=May 4, 2014|isbn=978-0-8093-2961-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1856 Republican National Convention]], Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for vice president.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857–1858, Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan]], leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]].&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''; Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution. Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarefsky, pp. 69–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln argued, &quot;The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], drawing on {{bibleref|Mark|3:25|9}}, &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
{{Further|Lincoln–Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Lincoln in 1858, the year of [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|his debates]] with [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] over slavery.]]

The Senate campaign featured the seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates]] of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1993), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that [[all men are created equal]], while Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 214–224.&lt;/ref&gt; The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' [[popular sovereignty]] theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the ''Dred Scott'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger,'' a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 242, 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, pp. 108–111.&lt;/ref&gt;—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[David Herbert Donald|Donald]] described the speech as a &quot;superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's ([[William H. Seward]]) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's ([[Salmon P. Chase]]) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860 Presidential nomination and campaign===
{{Main|Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln|United States presidential election, 1860}}

[[File:The Rail Candidate.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=Lincoln being carried by two men on a long board.|&quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;—Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is depicted as held up by the slavery issue—a slave on the left and party organization on the right.]]

On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], [[Norman B. Judd|Norman Judd]], [[Leonard Swett]], and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of &quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.&lt;ref&gt;Luthin, pp. 609–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, pp. 50–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that bind me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 247–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the ''Dred Scott'' decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 10, 13, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]], disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of &quot;free labor&quot;, whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Mansch, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2&amp;nbsp;percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'' vol 4. p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-55, 1861-crop.jpg|thumb|250px|The first photographic image of the new president]]
As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 267&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 267&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pp. 520, 569–570.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were attempts at compromise. The [[Crittenden Compromise]] would have extended the [[Missouri Compromise]] line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform.&lt;ref name=White360-361&gt;White, pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, &quot;I will suffer death before I consent&amp;nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vile_pp280&gt;Vile (2003), ''Encyclopedia of Constitutional Amendments: Proposed Amendments, and Amending Issues 1789–2002'' pp.&amp;nbsp;280–281&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.&lt;ref name=Lupton_2006&gt;Lupton (2006), [http://www.lib.niu.edu/2006/ih060934.html Abraham Lincoln and the Corwin Amendment], Retrieved January 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.&lt;ref name=Vile_p281&gt;Vile (2003), ''Encyclopedia of Constitutional Amendments: Proposed Amendments, and Amending Issues 1789–2002'' p.&amp;nbsp;281&lt;/ref&gt;

En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 273–277.&lt;/ref&gt; The president-elect then [[Baltimore Plot|evaded possible assassins]] in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, [[Allan Pinkerton]]. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 277–279.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln directed his [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|inaugural address]] to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
{{quote|Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that &quot;I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.&quot;|[[Lincoln's first inaugural address|First inaugural address]], 4 March 1861&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (2002), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: &quot;We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies&amp;nbsp;... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 268, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lincoln said as the war was ending:
:Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.&lt;ref&gt;March 4, 1865, [[Lincoln's second inaugural address]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the war===
{{POV|talk=habeas corpus section|date=January 2015}}
{{Main|American Civil War|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
[[File:Major Robert Anderson.jpg|alt=portrait|thumb|150px|[[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Anderson]], Ft. Sumter commander]]

The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Robert Anderson]], sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union'' (1959) vol 5 p 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at his failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and that the South was preparing for war.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald concludes that, &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oates, p. 226&quot;&gt;Oates, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to the defense of the American nation. Historian Allan Nevins says: 
:The thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment....Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings, speeches, resolutions, tenders of business support, the muster of companies and regiments, the determined action of governors and legislatures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''The War for the Union: The Improvised War 1861-1862'' (1959) pp 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell McClintock, ''Lincoln and the Decision for War: The Northern Response to Secession'' (2008)   pp 254-74 provides details of support across the North&lt;/ref&gt;

States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|local Maryland]] officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]'' in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler (2000), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Merryman]], a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, [[Roger B. Taney]], author of the controversial pro-slavery ''Dred Scott'' opinion, to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus,'' and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the [[Ex parte Merryman]] ruling.&lt;ref&gt;William C.

===Assuming command for the Union in the war===
After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as [[commander-in-chief]], using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending ''habeas corpus'', arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 303–304; Carwardine (2003), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln and others.]]
The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 315, 331–333, 338–339, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|Confiscation Act]] that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 314; Carwardine (2003), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 1861, General [[John C. Frémont]], the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting his superiors in Washington, a proclamation of [[martial law]] in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be [[court-martial]]ed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the [[Department of the West]] compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 314–317.&lt;/ref&gt; After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trent Affair]] of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFAdams&quot;&gt;Adams, pp. 540–562.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the ''Trent'' affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator [[Charles Sumner]], the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and an expert in British diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied [[Henry Halleck]]'s book, ''Elements of Military Art and Science'' from the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Prokopowicz, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the [[United States War Department|War Department]] in Washington, D.C. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[Simon Cameron]] with [[Edwin Stanton]] as [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]]. Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. &quot;Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together,&quot; say Thomas and Hyman.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman, ''Stanton, the Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War'' (Knopf, 1962) pp 71, 87, 229–30, 385 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 295–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a student of the European strategist [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]], of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, pp. 7, 66, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; he also knew well the importance of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 432–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General McClellan===
After the Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and the retirement of the aged [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief of all the Union armies.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 318–319.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his [[Peninsula Campaign]], longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 349–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|alt=Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent|thumb|250px|Lincoln and [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] after the [[Battle of Antietam]] in 1862.]]

Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed Henry Wager Halleck in March 1862, after McClellan's &quot;Harrison's Landing Letter&quot;, in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nevins 1960, pp. 2:159–162&quot;&gt;Nevins (1960), pp. 2:159–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nevins 1960, pp. 2:159–162&quot;/&gt; The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], formerly the USS ''Merrimack'', damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']]. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, pp. 478–479.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, pp. 478–480.&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;

McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|thumb|250px|Union soldiers before Marye's Heights, [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg, just prior to the battle of May 3, 1863]].]]
Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was stunningly [[Battle of Fredericksburg|defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg]] in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 429–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln brought in [[Joseph Hooker]], despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 6:433–44&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|mid-term elections]] in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of ''habeas corpus,'' [[Conscription|the military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Nevins vol 6 pp. 318–322, quote on p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati ''Gazette'' contended that the voters were &quot;depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 422–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May,&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 6:432–450.&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in [[Harper's Ferry]], and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by [[George Meade]], who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 444–447.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln and slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}

[[File:Emancipation proclamation.jpg|thumb|250px|Lincoln presents the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet. Painted by [[Francis Bicknell Carpenter]] in 1864|alt=A dark-haired, bearded, middle-aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men.]]

Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], under the constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackubin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp|title=The Liberator|first=Thomas Owens|last=Mackubin|date=March 25, 2004|work=National Review|publisher=National Review|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a7fJ9hj|archivedate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second [[Confiscation Acts|Confiscation Act]] was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that &quot;as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the highly influential ''New York Tribune'' fell for the ploy,&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1992), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his &quot;official duty&quot;) was preserving the Union:&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (2004), pp. 147–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union&amp;nbsp;... [¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 364, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur, ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union'' (Harvard University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the [[War Governors' Conference]]; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1960), pp. 2:239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.  By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to [[Andrew Johnson]], the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Douglass]] once observed of Lincoln: &quot;In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gettysburg Address (1863)===
{{Main|Gettysburg Address}}
[[File:Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|300px|The only confirmed photo of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, some three hours before [[Gettysburg Address|the speech]].]]
With the great Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the [[New York City draft riots]]. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 453–460.&lt;/ref&gt; Defying Lincoln's prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,&quot; the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulla&quot;&gt;Bulla (2010), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;. He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;. Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 460–466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, pp. 20, 27, 105, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Grant===
[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|alt=Painting of four men conferring in a ship's cabin, entitled &quot;The Peacemakers&quot;.|thumb|300px|President Lincoln (center right) with, from left, Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] and Admiral [[David Dixon Porter|Porter]] – [[The Peacemakers|1868 painting]] of events aboard the ''[[River Queen (steamboat)|River Queen]]'' in March 1865]]

Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'' (Vol. IV), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 490–492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864. This is often characterized as a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], given high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had &quot;almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (2009), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the [[James River]], forcing a siege and trench warfare outside [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehousehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html|title=The Peacemakers|publisher=The White House Historical Association|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a8J9jOa|archivedate=October 20, 2011|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and [[Philip Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's [[Shenandoah Valley]]. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. [[Mark E. Neely Jr.]] has argued that there was no effort to engage in &quot;[[total war]]&quot; against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (2004), pp. 434–458.&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=December 2014}}

Confederate general [[Jubal Anderson Early]] began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 516–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the [[Battle of Five Forks]] and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but [[freedmen]] greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] and the war was effectively over.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln|United States presidential election, 1864}}
While the war was still being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in [[War Democrats]] such as [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, pp. 53–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegeder, pp. 77–90.&lt;/ref&gt; At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 494–507.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref name=&quot;Grimsley, p. 80&quot;&gt;Grimsley, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

While the Democratic platform followed the &quot;Peace wing&quot; of the party and called the war a &quot;failure&quot;, their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and [[David Farragut]]'s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the [[perfidy]] of the Copperheads.&lt;ref&gt;Randall &amp; Current (1955), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grimsley, p. 80&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, pp. 274–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]]. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian [[Mark Noll]] concludes it ranks &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Noll, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln said:

{{quote|Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the [[wikt:bondman|bond-man's]] 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;. With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, ''Abraham Lincoln: Selected Speeches and Writings'' (Library of America edition, 2009) p 450&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era}}
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled &quot;The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union.&quot; The caption reads (Johnson): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.'' (Lincoln): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.'']]

As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals [[Andrew Johnson#General|Andrew Johnson]] and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 485–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'', Vol IV., p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-passes-the-13th-amendment |title=House passes the 13th Amendment — History.com This Day in History — 1/31/1865 |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon ratification, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Documents in American History: 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html|publisher=Library of Congress|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a9BIwNw|archivedate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. Lincoln biographers [[James G. Randall]] and [[Richard Current]], according to David Lincove, argue that:
:It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C&amp;pg=PA80|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Foner]] argues that:
:Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans..... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves.... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4b8m7cv3wTIC&amp;pg=PA335|year=2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=334–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redefining the republic and republicanism===
[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-116 by Gardner, 1865-crop.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=An older, tired-looking Abraham Lincoln with a beard.|Lincoln in February 1865, about two months before his death.]]

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term &quot;the United States&quot; has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (&quot;these United States&quot;), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidential Proclamation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/12/presidential-proclamation-civil-war-sesquicentennial|title=Presidential Proclamation-Civil War Sesquicentennial|publisher=The White House|date=April 12, 2011|quote=...&amp;nbsp;a new meaning was conferred on our country's name&amp;nbsp;... |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62aAPoA6B|archivedate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of ''republican values''. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diggins, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.&lt;ref&gt;Orville Vernon Burton, ''The Age of Lincoln'' (2008) p 243&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1861, in [[Lincoln's first inaugural address]], he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Belz (1998), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

===Other enactments===
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (2001), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1993), pp. 450–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]], the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the [[Revenue Act of 1862]] to a progressive rate structure.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]] provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 2001 p. 424&quot;&gt;Donald (2001), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the &quot;[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]&quot; in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, pp. 210–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]'' published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 501–502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 471&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during [[James Madison]]'s presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 471&quot;/&gt; In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|page=48|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=0-89997-244-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial appointments===

* [[Noah Haynes Swayne]] – 1862
* [[Samuel Freeman Miller]] – 1862
* [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] – 1862
* [[Stephen Johnson Field]] – 1863
* [[Salmon P. Chase|Salmon Portland Chase]] – 1864 (Chief Justice)

[[File:Mathew Brady, Portrait of Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, officer of the United States government (1860–1865, full version).jpg|thumb|right|[[Salmon Portland Chase]] was Lincoln's choice to be [[Chief Justice of the United States]].]]
Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that &quot;we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 471&quot;/&gt; Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]], nominated January 21, 1862 and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. [[Samuel Freeman Miller]], nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. [[Stephen Johnson Field]], a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Blue, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other judicial appointments====
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and 27 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. Lincoln appointed no judges to the [[United States circuit court]]s during his time in office.

===States admitted to the Union===
[[West Virginia]], admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. [[Nevada]], which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 300, 539.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination and funeral==
{{main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln}}
[[File:Lincoln assassination slide c1900.png|thumb|left||alt=Image of Lincoln being shot by Booth while sitting in a theater booth.|Shown in the presidential booth of Ford's Theatre, from left to right, are assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]], Abraham Lincoln, [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[Clara Harris]], and [[Henry Rathbone]].]]
[[John Wilkes Booth]] was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 586–587.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy)&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (2000), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning that the President and Grant would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]], Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater, as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes. Without his main bodyguard, [[Ward Hill Lamon]], Lincoln left to attend the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on April 14. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 594–597.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13&amp;nbsp;pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Lincolns-Missing-Bodyguard.html|title=Lincoln's Missing Bodyguard|first=Paul|last=Martin|date=April 8, 2010|work=Smithsonian Magazine|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62aAqLOzq|archivedate=October 20, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some {{convert|70|mi|km}} south of Washington. After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] on April 26.&lt;ref&gt;Steers, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor [[Charles Leale]], an Army surgeon, found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse. Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/report-first-doctor-reach-shot-lincoln-found-175353998.html|title=Report of first doctor to reach shot Lincoln found}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dying President was taken across the street to [[Petersen House]]. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22&amp;nbsp;am on April 15. Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, &quot;Now he belongs to the ages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 598–599, 686. Witnesses have provided other versions of the quote, i.e. &quot;He now belongs to the ages.&quot; and &quot;He is a man for the ages.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach &quot;'''United States'''&quot; and for three weeks the ''Lincoln Special'' [[Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln#Funeral train|funeral train]] decorated in black bunting&lt;ref&gt;

As a young man, Lincoln was a [[religious skepticism|religious skeptic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas L. Wilson|title=Honor's Voice: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KCM50uZMsQMC&amp;pg=PA84|year=1999|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=84|isbn=978-0-307-76581-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the words of a biographer, an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]].&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (1997), pp. 27–55.&lt;/ref&gt; He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;On claims that Lincoln was baptized by an associate of [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], see {{cite journal|url=http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html|last=Martin|first=Jim|title=The secret baptism of Abraham Lincoln|journal=Restoration Quarterly|volume=38|issue=2|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 48–49, 514–515.&lt;/ref&gt; He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others.  Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A. Noll|title=A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VGF3wbzzy9QC&amp;pg=PA322|year=1992|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|pages=321–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, Lincoln believed in &quot;providence&quot; in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.&lt;ref&gt;Grant R. Brodrecht, ''&quot;Our country&quot;: Northern evangelicals and the Union during the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2008) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God.&lt;ref&gt;Parrillo, pp. 227–253.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 251–254.&lt;/ref&gt; After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God &quot;could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
{{main|Medical and mental health of Abraham Lincoln}}
Several claims abound that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b|MEN2b]],&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/05/was-lincoln-dying-before-he-was-shot/17955/|title=Was Lincoln Dying Before He Was Shot?|date=May 20, 2009|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which manifests with a [[medullary thyroid carcinoma]], [[Mucosal neuromata with endocrine tumors|mucosal neuromas]] and a [[Marfanoid|Marfinoid appearance]]. Others simply claim he had [[Marfan's syndrome]], based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible [[aortic regurgitation]], which can cause bobbing of the head ([[De Musset's sign|DeMusset's sign]]){{snd}} based on blurring of Lincoln's head in photographs, which back then had a long exposure time.

==Historical reputation==
{{see also|Abraham Lincoln cultural depictions}}
In [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|surveys of US scholars ranking presidents]]&lt;!--Lincoln is 1st in 9 of 17 on that page--&gt; conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranking Our Presidents&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gallup&quot;/&gt; A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taranto&quot;&gt;Taranto, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls: Schlesinger 1948, Schlesinger 1962, 1982 Murray Blessing Survey, ''Chicago Tribune'' 1982 poll, Schlesinger 1996, CSPAN 1996, Ridings-McIver 1996, ''Time'' 2008, and CSPAN 2009. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Densen, John V., Editor, ''Reassessing The Presidency, The Rise of the Executive State and the Decline of Freedom'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2001), pgs. 1–32; Ridings, William H., &amp; Stuard B. McIver, ''Rating The Presidents, A Ranking of U.S. Leaders, From the Great and Honorable to the Dishonest and Incompetent'' (Citadel Press, Kensington Publishing Corp., 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

President Lincoln's assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.&lt;ref&gt;Chesebrough, pp. 76, 79, 106, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln Museum Exterior.jpg|alt=Exterior photograph of museum|thumb|left|The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] focuses on Lincoln scholarship and popular interpretation]]

Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the Mall in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2000), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Deal]] era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the [[Cold War]] years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2009), pp. 23, 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to [[Conservatism in the United States|political conservatives]]&lt;ref&gt;Havers, p. 96. Apart from neo-Confederates such as [[Mel Bradford]] who denounced his treatment of the white South.&lt;/ref&gt; for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of [[John Locke|Lockean]] and [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Belz (2006), pp. 514–518.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graebner, pp. 67–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt; As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the [[Jacksonian Democracy|agrarian Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 196, 198, 228, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; William C. Harris found that Lincoln's &quot;reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation &quot;in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform&quot;. Randall concludes that, &quot;he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian [[Lerone Bennett Jr.|Lerone Bennett]], were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues.&lt;ref&gt;Zilversmit, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, pp. 35–42.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed [[American Colonization Society|sending freed slaves]] to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;&lt;ref&gt;Dirck (2008), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was a &quot;moral visionary&quot; who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.&lt;ref&gt;Striner, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Cashin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley &amp; Lewis, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered &quot;erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule&quot; in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2009), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of [[negative capability]], defined by the poet [[John Keats]] and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were &quot;content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Spielberg, Doris Kearns Goodwin,  and Tony Kushner, &quot;Mr. Lincoln Goes to Hollywood&quot;, ''Smithsonian'' (2012) 43#7 pp. 46–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Stokes, &quot;Abraham Lincoln and the Movies&quot;, ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 12 (June 2011), 203–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerial view of Lincoln Memorial - east side EDIT.jpeg|thumb|alt=An aerial photo a large white building with big pillars.|[[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.]]
Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of [[United States currency]], the [[Penny (United States coin)|penny]] and the [[United States five-dollar bill|$5 bill]]. His likeness also appears on many [[U.S. presidents on U.S. postage stamps#Abraham Lincoln|postage stamps]] and has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis, p. 194&quot;&gt;Dennis, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|capital]] of Nebraska.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The most famous and most visited memorials are the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.; Lincoln's sculpture on [[Mount Rushmore]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Rushmore National Memorial|url=http://www.nps.gov/moru/historyculture/index.htm|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62dfUtolh|archivedate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford's Theatre]] and [[Petersen House]] (where he died) in Washington and the [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]], located in Springfield, Illinois, not far from [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|Lincoln's home]] and [[Lincoln's Tomb|his tomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alplm.com/|title=The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62i1pRLLD|archivedate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordstheatre.org/home/about-fords|title=About Ford's |publisher=Ford's Theatre|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62i1ux7Sk|archivedate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with &quot;a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life&quot;. During the Great Depression, he argues,  Lincoln served &quot;as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful&quot;. Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, &quot;What would Lincoln do?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Schwartz, ''Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America''  (2009)  pp. xi, 9, 24&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this &quot;fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness&quot;.  He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Schwartz, ''Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America''  (2009)  p. xi, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aristotle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|r|ɪ|ˌ|s|t|ɒ|t|əl}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/aristotle &quot;Aristotle&quot;] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'', HarperCollins Publishers, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀριστοτέλης}} {{IPA-grc|aristotélɛːs}}, ''Aristotélēs''; 384{{snd}}322&amp;nbsp;BC)&lt;ref&gt;That these undisputed dates (the first half of the Olympiad year 384/383 BC, and in 322 shortly before the death of Demosthenes) are correct was shown already by [[August Boeckh]] (''Kleine Schriften'' VI 195); for further discussion, see [[Felix Jacoby]] on ''[[FGrHist]]'' 244 F 38. Ingemar Düring, ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'', Göteborg, 1957, {{p.|253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]] and scientist born in the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalkidiki|Chalkidice]], on the northern periphery of [[Classical Greece]]. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography of Aristotle |url=http://www.biography.com/people/aristotle-9188415?page=1#early-life |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At eighteen, he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]]&amp;nbsp;347&amp;nbsp;BC). His writings cover many subjects –&amp;nbsp;including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], politics and government&amp;nbsp;– and constitute the first comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]]. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] starting from 343&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', &quot;Aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history ... [and] every scientist is in his debt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Britannica Guide to the 100 Most Influential Scientists |publisher=Running Press |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2008 |pages=12 |isbn=9780762434213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to [[empiricism]].{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=6}} He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on [[perception]]. Aristotle's views on [[natural science]]s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.

Aristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended into the [[Renaissance]] and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern [[formal logic]].

In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as &quot;The First Teacher&quot; ({{lang-ar|{{big|المعلم الأول}}}}).

His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues –&amp;nbsp;[[Cicero]] described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cicero |first=Marcus Tullius |quote=''veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles'' |title=Academica Priora |publisher= |date=106–43 BC |url=http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/gutenberg/1/4/9/7/14970/14970-h/14970-h.htm#BkII_119 |location=Book II, chapter XXXVIII, §119 |doi= |accessdate=25 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), {{p.|9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sum of his work's influence often ranks him among the world's top personalities of all time with the greatest influence, along with his teacher [[Plato]], and his pupil [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/30/whos-most-significant-historical-figure|title = Guardian on Time Magazine's 100 personalities of all time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the-most-influential-people-of-all-time|title = Ranker.com - The most influential people of all time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Aristotle, whose name means &quot;the best purpose&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Michael |title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name &quot;Aristotle&quot; |url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/aristotle |work=Behind the Name: The Etymology and History of First Names |publisher=www.behindthename.com |accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 384&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalcidice]], about 55&amp;nbsp;km (34 miles) east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle: The Great Philosophers |author=McLeisch, Kenneth Cole |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92392-1 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of]] [[Macedon]].  Although there is little information on Aristotle's childhood, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Anagnostopoulos, G., &quot;Aristotle's Life&quot; in ''A Companion to Aristotle'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2009), {{p.|4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the age of eighteen, Aristotle moved to [[Athens]] to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]]. He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47&amp;nbsp;BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lord Intro&quot;&gt;Carnes Lord, introduction to ''The Politics'' by Aristotle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. There, he traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island. Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in 343&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|An early Islamic portrayal of Aristotle (right) and [[Alexander the Great]].]]

Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Green&quot;&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', University of California Press Ltd. (Oxford, England) 1991, {{p.|58|59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards [[Persia]] was unabashedly [[Ethnocentricism|ethnocentric]]. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be &quot;a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Green&quot;/&gt;

By 335&amp;nbsp;BC, Artistotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the [[Suda]], he also had an [[eromenos]], [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].&lt;ref&gt;William George Smith,''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', {{vol.|3}}, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html {{p.|88}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

This period in Athens, between 335 and 323&amp;nbsp;BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt; He wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]]'' (''On the Soul'') and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, [[embryology]], geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge.

Near the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', University of California Press Ltd. (Oxford, England), 1991, {{p.|379}} and 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Eurymedon the Hierophant]] denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor, prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis]], explaining: &quot;I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=W. T. |title=The Classical Mind: A History of Western Philosophy |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1980 |page=216 |isbn=0155383124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Marciana'' 41, cf. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] ''Varia historica'' 3.36, Ingemar Düring, ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'', Göteborg, 1957, T44a-e.&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}a reference to Athens's prior [[Trial of Socrates|trial and execution of Socrates]]. He died in Euboea of [[natural causes]] later that same year, having named his student [[Antipater]] as his chief [[executor]] and leaving a [[Will (law)|will]] in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ifqGuiHo6eQC&amp;pg=PA3862&amp;dq=Antipater+Aristotle+will&amp;sig=sQzQVBdRmk-spNdZnyd1MwzAPTc Aristotle's Will], ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' by Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haase.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Walston argues that the tomb of Aristotle is located on the sacred way between Chalcis and Eretria and to have contained two styluses, a pen, a signet-ring and some terra-cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of Aristotle in the form of some skull fragments.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Politics of Aristotle'' translated by Ernest Barker, Oxford: Clarendom Press, 1946, p. xxiii, note 2, who refers to ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'', vol. xii, fasc. ix, s.v. Eretria.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the details of the life of Aristotle are not well-established.  The biographies of Aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.&lt;ref&gt;See Shields, C., &quot;Aristotle's Philosophical Life and Writings&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Aristotle'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2012), {{pp.|3|16}}. Düring, I., ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'' (Göteborg, 1957) is a collection of [an overview of?] ancient biographies of Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==

===Logic===
[[File:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|Aristotle portrayed in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' as a scholar of the 15th century AD.]]
{{main|Term logic}}
{{details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}
With the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,&lt;ref&gt;MICHAEL DEGNAN, 1994. Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic. ''Philosophical Books'' 35.2 (April 1994): 81–89.&lt;/ref&gt; and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, John (2009). &quot;Aristotle's Demonstrative Logic&quot;. History and Philosophy of Logic, 30: 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] stated in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of [[deductive inference]].

====History====
Aristotle &quot;says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last =Bocheński
 | first =I. M.
 | title =Ancient Formal Logic
 | publisher =North-Holland Publishing Company

 | location =Amsterdam
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was devised before him, by [[Prodicus of Ceos]], who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deductive system]], he could never actually construct one, thus he relied instead on his [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;&gt;Bocheński, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analytics and the ''Organon''====
{{main|Organon}}
What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'', Aristotle himself would have labeled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE:
#''Categories''
#''On Interpretation''
#''Prior Analytics''
#''Posterior Analytics''
#''Topics''
#''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics'') and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;/&gt;

===Aristotle's epistemology===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]''&lt;!--This should link to an article about the famous artwork--&gt;, a fresco by [[Raphael]]. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, while holding a copy of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in his hand, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]], while holding a copy of ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'']]
[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|&quot;Aristotle&quot; by Francesco Hayez (1791–1882)]]

Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]], however, finds the universal in [[particular]] things, which he calls the essence of things, while in Plato's ontology, the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, [[epistemology]] is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance (see ''[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]'', below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.

If logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.

Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.

His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''History of Animals'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given &quot;current astronomical demonstrations&quot; that &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then&amp;nbsp;... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Meteorology'' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the Universe' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.

Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a [[geocentrism|geocentric cosmology]] that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]].

Because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|Burent, John.]] 1928. ''Platonism'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.

===Geology===
As quoted from [[w:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell's]] ''[[Principles of Geology]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;
He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the [[Palus Maeotis]] within sixty years from his own time&amp;nbsp;... He alludes&amp;nbsp;... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.

He says [12th chapter of his ''Meteorics''] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.' The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.'&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell]], ''[http://archive.org/details/principlesgeolo01unkngoog Principles of Geology]'', 1832, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]] and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).

Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. All that is earthly tends toward the center of the Universe, i.e., the center of the Earth. Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. This is &quot;natural motion&quot;—motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises.  Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.

====Motion====
{{main|potentiality and actuality}}
Aristotle defined [[Motion (physics)|motion]] as the actuality of a potentiality ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 201a10–11, 201a27–29, 201b4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. Because [[Aristotle#Substance, potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]] are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the &quot;as such&quot; to the definition is critical to understanding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sachs|first=Joe|title=Aristotle: Motion and its Place in Nature|year=2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causality, the four causes==== &lt;!--Linked from [[Retrocausality]] and [[Physics (Aristotle)]] (see [[WP:MOS#Section management]])--&gt;
{{main|Four causes}}
Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors:
*[[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.
*The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter.  It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create his drawings.
*The [[efficient cause]] is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. So, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.
*The [[final cause]] is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs.

Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.

Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.

====Optics====
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The second oldest written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] (after [[Mozi]] c. 400 BC) can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350&amp;nbsp;BC in ''Problemata''. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Lahanas |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm |title=Optics and ancient Greeks |publisher=Mlahanas.de |accessdate=26 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051535/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chance and spontaneity====
According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.

For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysics===
{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}
[[File:Uni Freiburg - Philosophen 4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Aristotle (1915) by Cipri Adolf Bermann at the [[University of Freiburg]] [[Freiburg im Breisgau|im Breisgau]]]]

Aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of [[hylomorphism|immaterial]] being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of [[abstraction]].&quot; He refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science.&quot;

====Substance, potentiality and actuality====
{{see also|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]] (''ousia'') in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. In book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10–30&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and [[On Generation and Corruption]] 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:
# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;
# locomotion, which is change in space; and
# alteration, which is change in quality.

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form.

Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate&amp;nbsp;– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise&amp;nbsp;– acting).

Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5–10&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.

With this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a–b&lt;/ref&gt;

====Universals and particulars====
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}
Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.

Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. [[Bertrand Russell]] is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;.

Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.

In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.

===Biology and medicine===
In Aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.

====Empirical research program====
[[File:Octopus3.jpg|thumb|Octopus swimming]]
[[File:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''Torpedo fuscomaculata'']]
[[File:Triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|Leopard shark]]
Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''Octopus'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]''). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology''. Oxford 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another good example of his methods comes from the ''Generation of Animals'' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.

He gave accurate descriptions of [[ruminant]]s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]] ''[[Mustelus mustelus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kearns, &quot;Animals, knowledge about,&quot; in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classification of living things====
Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of birds, mammals and fishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;BergstromDugatkin2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carl T. Bergstrom|author2=Lee Alan Dugatkin|title=Evolution|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SeaEZwEACAAJ|year=2012|publisher=Norton|isbn=978-0-393-92592-0|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; His classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[hemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).

For [[Charles Singer]], &quot;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;/&gt; Aristotle's ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &quot;[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]&quot; (''scala naturae''  or [[Great Chain of Being]]), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[final cause]]s, guided all natural processes. Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,&quot; Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the ''scala naturae''.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201–202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt; His system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.

Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.

He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 45&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' Vol. 1 pp. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

====Successor: Theophrastus====
[[File:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 300 BC.]]
{{main|Theophrastus|Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)}}
Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany—the ''History of Plants''—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.

Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90–91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence on Hellenistic medicine====
{{details|Medicine in ancient Greece}}
After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 252&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 56&lt;/ref&gt; Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] claimed that there was &quot;nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90–94; quotation from p 91&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'', p 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
Aristotle's [[psychology]], given in his treatise [[On the Soul]] (''peri psyche'', often known by its [[Latin]] title ''De Anima''), posits three kinds of [[soul]] (&quot;psyches&quot;): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.

For Aristotle, the soul (''psyche'') was a simpler concept than it is for us today. By soul he simply meant the [[Hylomorphism#Body–soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ &quot;Psychology&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Memory====

According to Aristotle, [[memory]] is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal &quot;appearance&quot; and an occurrence in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloch |first=David |url=http://books.google.com/?id=QwTHng_5RqAC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Aristotle+on+Memory+and+Recollection#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20on%20Memory%20and%20Recollection&amp;f=false |title=Aristotle on Memory and Recollection |year=2007 |page=12|isbn=9004160469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) in which Aristotle defines in ''De Anima'', as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory. Aristotle believed an &quot;imprint&quot; becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of [[sense|sensation]], [[common sense]], and [[thinking]] .{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=61}} The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception. It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard, every experience ends up as a mental image in memory
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carruthers |first=Mary |url=http://books.google.com/?id=dntrAnqfIasC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=The+book+of+memory:+the+study+of+memory+in+medieval+times#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20book%20of%20memory%3A%20the%20study%20of%20memory%20in%20medieval%20times&amp;f=false |title=The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture |year=2007 |page=16|isbn=9780521429733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle uses the word &quot;memory&quot; for two basic abilities. First, the actual retaining of the experience in the [[mnemonic]] &quot;imprint&quot; that can develop from sensation. Second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the &quot;imprint&quot; due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore, memory is of the past, {{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=25}} prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our &quot;imprints&quot; cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.

Aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the &quot;imprint&quot; can easily continue. However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new &quot;imprints&quot;. He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an &quot;imprint&quot;. Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new &quot;imprints&quot;. Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have [[perception]] of time.

=====Recollection=====
Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or &quot;imprints&quot;, people are continually weaving together new &quot;imprints&quot; of things they experience. In order to search for these &quot;imprints&quot;, people search the memory itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warren |first=Howard |url=http://books.google.com/?id=D4IXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=The+history+of+the+association+of+psychology#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20history%20of%20the%20association%20of%20psychology&amp;f=false |title=A History of the Association Psychology |year=1921 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the memory, if one [[experience]] is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. [[Recall (memory)|Recollection]] occurs when one experience naturally follows another. If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is needed, one memory will stimulate the other. If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=25}}

Recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory &quot;imprint&quot; after some time has passed. Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being (human or animal) and the abilities the human or animal possesses .{{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=19}} Only humans will remember &quot;imprints&quot; of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. Recollection of an &quot;imprint&quot; is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences. When an &quot;imprint&quot; is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related &quot;imprints&quot;.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=296}}

Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain &quot;imprints&quot;, was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity. These three laws make up his [[Laws of Association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=259}}

====Dreams====

=====Sleep=====
Before understanding Aristotle’s take on dreams, first his idea of sleep must be examined. Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in ''On Sleep and Wakefulness''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holowchak|first1=Mark|title=Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out|journal=Ancient Philosophy|date=1996|volume=16|issue=2|pages=405–423|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/ancientphil/Ancient-Philosophy|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shute|first1=Clarence|title=The Psychology of Aristotle: An Analysis of the Living Being|date=1941|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=Morningsdie Heights: New York|pages=115–118|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or of digestion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt;  so it is vital to the body, including the senses, so it can be revitalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function  as they do during wakefulness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt;  Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire, which is the result of a sensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; However, the senses are able to work during sleep,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; Also, all of the senses are not inactive during sleep, only the ones that are weary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt;

=====Theory of dreams=====
Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; When they look away from that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion.  When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt;  When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt;  So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.&lt;ref name=Modrak&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Modrak|first1=Deborah|title=Dreams and Method in Aristotle|journal=Skepsis: A Journal for Philosophy and Interdisciplinary Research|date=2009|volume=20|pages=169–181|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; When a person is asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt;

When asleep, a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt;  Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep, they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their dream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.

One component of Aristotle’s theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs.&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webb|first1=Wilse|title=Dreamtime and dreamwork: Decoding the language of the night. New consciousness reader series|date=1990|publisher=Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc.|location=Los Angeles, CA, England|isbn=0-87477-594-9|pages=174–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot;/&gt; Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot;/&gt; These ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams, but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot;/&gt;

Aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not. He claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; Secondly, any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, Aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses, the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt;

===Practical philosophy===

====Ethics====
{{main|Aristotelian ethics}}
Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchē]]'' (normally translated as ''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or sometimes &quot;well being&quot;. To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[aretē]]''), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I. See for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a].&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished [[theory|theoretical]] or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Politics====
{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}
In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, &quot;for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Politics 1253a19–24&lt;/ref&gt; He also famously stated that &quot;man is by nature a political animal&quot;. Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ebenstein | first =Alan |author2=William Ebenstein | title =Introduction to Political Thinkers | publisher =Wadsworth Group | year =2002 | page =59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political &quot;community&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; (''koinōnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29–31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1–3) --&gt;.&quot; This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, K. (1957) &quot;Aristotle Discovers the Economy&quot; in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78–115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhetoric and poetics====
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Olivia, and Temple, Robert (translators), [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_0 The Complete Fables By Aesop] Penguin Classics, 1998. ISBN 0-14-044649-4 Cf. Introduction, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on women===
{{main|Aristotle's views on women}}
Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, [[feminist metaphysics]] have accused Aristotle of [[misogyny]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeland&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Feminist Interpretations of Aristotle | publisher=Penn State University Press | author=Freeland, Cynthia A. | year=1998 | isbn=0-271-01730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morsink&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/4330727 | title=Was Aristotle's Biology Sexist? | author=Morsink, Johannes | journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=Spring 1979 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=83–112 | doi=10.1007/bf00128136}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his ''Rhetoric'' that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle; Roberts, W.

==Loss and preservation of his works==
{{see also|Corpus Aristotelicum}}
Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotle's &quot;lost&quot; works stray considerably in characterization&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;&gt;Terence Irwin and [[Gail Fine]], [[Cornell University]], ''Aristotle: Introductory Readings.'' Indianapolis, Indiana: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. (1996), Introduction, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt; from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt; Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt; The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle's at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt;

Some of the individual works within the corpus, including the ''[[Constitution of Athens]],'' are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's &quot;school,&quot; perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision. Others, such as ''[[On Colors]],'' may have been produced by Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus|Straton]]. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the ''De Plantis,'' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and [[astrological]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Thorndike, &quot;Chiromancy in Medieval Latin Manuscripts,&quot; ''Speculum'' 40 (1965), pp. 674–706; Roger A. Pack, &quot;Pseudo-Arisoteles: Chiromantia,&quot; ''Archives d'histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge'' 39 (1972), pp. 289–320; Pack, &quot;A Pseudo-Aristotelian Chiromancy,&quot; ''Archives d'histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge'' 36 (1969), pp. 189–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the &quot;[[exoteric]]&quot; and the &quot;[[esoteric]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 12; Aristotle himself: ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1102a26–27. Aristotle himself never uses the term &quot;esoteric&quot; or &quot;acroamatic&quot;. For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408–410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the school (esoteric). Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students).&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, Life and Work, p. 12&quot;&gt;Barnes, &quot;Life and Work&quot;, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation.  The 5th century [[neoplatonist]] [[Ammonius Hermiae]] writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]] so that &quot;good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (''Fragments'' of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us&lt;ref&gt;.The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, &quot;Roman Aristotle&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sulla.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] and then by the philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar – Page 513, Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 22 – Page 131, Grolier Incorporated – Juvenile Nonfiction&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides &quot;the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair.

Second, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.

On the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle's school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Fragments|dialogues and other &quot;exoteric&quot; texts]] which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.&lt;ref&gt;Anagnostopoulos, G., &quot;Aristotle's Works and Thoughts&quot;, ''A Companion to Aristotle'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2009), p. 16.  See also, Barnes, J., &quot;Life and Work&quot;, ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;10–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Rembrandt - Aristotle with a Bust of Homer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Aristotle with a bust of [[Homer]], by [[Rembrandt]].]]

More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher [[Bryan Magee]], &quot;it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Magee |first=Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Magee |title=The Story of Philosophy |year=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of [[formal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie (1990). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=8EG0yV0cGoEC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of Greek philosophy: Aristotle : an encounter]''&quot;. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p.156. ISBN 0-521-38760-4&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the study of [[zoology]], and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34560/Aristotle |title=Aristotle (Greek philosopher) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=26 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422103155/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34560/Aristotle| archivedate= 22 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |origyear=1926 |year=2006 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. |location=United States |isbn=978-0-671-73916-4 |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these achievements, the influence of Aristotle's errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably. [[Bertrand Russell]] notes that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine&quot;. Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as &quot;repulsive&quot;, and calls his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy&quot;. Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt;

===Later Greek philosophers===
The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained &quot;Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Byzantine scholars===
Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were [[John Philoponus]], Elias, and David in the sixth century, and [[Stephen of Alexandria]] in the early seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' London, 1990, 20, 28, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' (London, 1990) 233–274.&lt;/ref&gt; After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and [[Michael of Ephesus]] reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[Anna Comnena]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' (London, 1990) 20–21; 28–29, 393–406; 407–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Islamic theologians===
Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early [[Islamic theology]]. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by [[Muslim]] philosophers, scientists and scholars.  [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. [[Alkindus]] considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy&lt;ref&gt;''Rasa'il'' I, 103, 17, Abu Rida&lt;/ref&gt; and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the &quot;exemplar&quot; for all future philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;''Comm. Magnum'' in Aristotle'', ''De Anima'', III, 2, 43 Crawford&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the &quot;First Teacher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''al-mua'llim al-thani'', ''Aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; The title &quot;teacher&quot; was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasr|first=Seyyed Hossein|title=The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia|year=1996|publisher=Curzon Press|isbn=0-7007-0314-4|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the [[Greeks|Greek]] theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with [[Plato]] essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Influence on Western Christian theologians===
With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the ''Organon'' made by [[Boethius]]. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by [[Gerard of Cremona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|arabic-islamic-influence|Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the original Greek, such as those by [[James of Venice]] and [[William of Moerbeke]].

After [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his theology, working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|aristotelianism-renaissance|Aristotelianism in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle is referred to as &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'' at his beddes heed''
:''Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,''
:''Of aristotle and his philosophie,''&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Prologue, lines 295–295&lt;/ref&gt;
The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],
:''I saw the Master there of those who know,''
:''Amid the philosophic family,''
:''By all admired, and by all reverenced;''
:''There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,''
:''Who stood beside him closer than the rest.''&lt;ref&gt;''vidi 'l maestro di color che sanno''
''seder tra filosofica famiglia.''&lt;br&gt;
''Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno'':&lt;br&gt;
''quivi vid'ïo Socrate e Platone''&lt;br&gt;
''che 'nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno;''&lt;br&gt; Dante, ''L'Inferno'' (Hell), Canto IV. Lines 131–135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Enlightenment thinkers===
The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of [[slavery|slaves]] and others to the virtue – or ''arete'' – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. [[Ayn Rand]] accredited Aristotle as &quot;the greatest philosopher in history&quot; and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy'', Polity Press, 2007, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of works==
{{main|Corpus Aristotelicum}}

The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of [[Immanuel Bekker]]'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.

==Eponym==

The [[Aristotle Mountains]] along the [[Oscar II Coast]] of [[Graham Land]], [[Antarctica]], are named after Aristotle. He was the first person known to conjecture the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and call it &quot;Antarctica&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137410 Aristotle Mountains.] [[SCAR]] [[Composite Antarctic Gazetteer]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An American in Paris''''' is a [[jazz]]-influenced [[symphonic poem]] by the American composer [[George Gershwin]], written in 1928. Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]], it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s and is one of his best-known compositions.

Gershwin composed ''An American in Paris'' on commission from the conductor [[Walter Damrosch]]. He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], [[saxophone]]s, and automobile horns. He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the [[New York City|New York]] premiere of the composition, which took place on December&amp;nbsp;13, 1928 in [[Carnegie Hall]], with Damrosch conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gershwin completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2983 | title = An American in Paris: About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author = Richard Freed | accessdate = 5 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]], noting that: &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot; When the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], &quot;our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of [[homesickness]].&quot; But, &quot;nostalgia is not a fatal disease.&quot; The American visitor &quot;once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life&quot; and &quot;the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant.&quot;

==Background==
[[Maurice Ravel]] met Gershwin in New York during Ravel's tour of the United States. In that meeting, Gershwin asked Ravel to be his teacher, to which Ravel responded that it was better to be a first-rate Gershwin than a second-rate Ravel. Instead, Ravel recommended that Gershwin see [[Nadia Boulanger]] in Paris. Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in Paris.

Gershwin arrived in Paris in March 1928. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Ernest Hemingway]]; and artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. Gershwin met with Boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music. Boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him. This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''.

==Composition==
Gershwin based ''An American in Paris'' on a melodic fragment called &quot;Very Parisienne&quot;, written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. He described the piece as a &quot;rhapsodic ballet&quot; because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in ''[[Musical America]]'', &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot;

The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[Ternary form|ABA format]]. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main &quot;walking&quot; themes in the &quot;Allegretto grazioso&quot; and develops a third theme in the &quot;Subito con brio&quot;. The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Les Six]]. This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's &quot;Andante ma con ritmo deciso&quot; introduces the American [[Blues]] and spasms of homesickness. The &quot;Allegro&quot; that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. &quot;Moderato con grazia&quot; is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the &quot;walking&quot; themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “Grandioso.”

==Instrumentation==
''An American in Paris'' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in B flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[Triangle (instrument)|triangle]], [[wood block]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as A, B, C and D, [[alto saxophone]]/[[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, [[baritone saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and [[String section|strings]].

The revised edition by F. Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments.

[[William Merrigan Daly|William Daly]] arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in 1929.

==Response==
Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''An American in Paris''. He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with &quot;a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.&quot; Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[César Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, &quot;It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.&quot;

==Preservation status==

On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[Historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[University of Michigan]], are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent. It is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin's composition process. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/&lt;/ref&gt;

The score to ''An American in Paris'' is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released. The project may take 30 to 40 years to complete. The first edition will probably be published by 2023. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?page_id=59&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/09/george-and-ira-gershwin-critical-edition_20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
[[File:American in Paris.tif|thumb|First recording]]
''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for [[RCA Victor]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. The radio broadcast of the September&amp;nbsp;8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the music in [[Carnegie Hall]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The [[Seattle Symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today. &lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900628&amp;slug=1079541&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in film==
In 1951, MGM released the musical ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]]. Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the ''An American in Paris'' symphonic poem (arranged for the film by [[Johnny Green]]), costing $500,000.

A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', released in 1997.

The [[Academy Award]]s are the oldest awards ceremony for achievements in motion pictures. The '''Academy Award for Best Production Design''' recognizes achievement in [[art director#In film|art direction]] on a film. The category's original name was '''Best Art Direction''', but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the 85th Academy Awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Rules&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120830.html |title=Music Rules Approved for 85th Academy Awards |accessdate=2012-08-31 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This change resulted from the Art Director's branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] being renamed the Designer's branch. Since 1947, the award is shared with the Set Decorator(s).

The films below are listed with their production year (for example, the 2000 Academy Award for Best Art Direction is given to a film from 1999). In the lists below, the winner of the award for each year is shown first, followed by the other nominees.

'''The Academy Awards''' or '''The Oscars''' (the official title was rebranded as ''The Oscars'' in 2013 – changed from ''The Academy Awards'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pond|first=Steve|title=AMPAS Drops '85th Academy Awards' - Now It's Just 'The Oscars'|url=http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/ampas-drops-85th-academy-awards-now-its-just-oscars-78211|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=The Wrap|date=19 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105173652/http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/ampas-drops-85th-academy-awards-now-its-just-oscars-78211|archivedate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual American awards ceremony honoring cinematic achievements in the [[film industry]]. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette, officially the Academy Award of Merit, that is better known by its nickname Oscar. The awards, first presented in 1929 at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]], are overseen by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |title = About the Academy Awards |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate = 13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407234926/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |archivedate = 7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html | title=The Birth of Oscar | first=Andrew | last=Essex | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=14 May 1999 | accessdate=2 March 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111215005/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html | archivedate=2013-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards ceremony was first televised in 1953 and is now seen live in more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Academy Awards|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=13 January 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhyVna9|archivedate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscars is also the oldest entertainment awards ceremony; its equivalents, the [[Emmy Awards]] for television, the [[Tony Awards]] for theatre, and the [[Grammy Awards]] for music and recording, are modeled after the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE OSCARS - FEB 24TH 2013|url=http://www.platinumagencygroup.co.uk/#!los-angeles/c1drk|website=platinumagencygroup.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy Awards are widely considered to be the most prestigious cinema awards ceremony in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/01/04/the-oscars-films-possibly-in-line-for-cinemas-most-prestigious-award/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[86th Academy Awards]] ceremony was held on March 2, 2014, at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Los Angeles, later than usual as to not clash with the [[Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2014 Oscars show moves to March to avoid Winter Olympics clash|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-film-oscars2014l2n0ch1d5-20130325,0,4480470.story|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=25 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401213550/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-film-oscars2014l2n0ch1d5-20130325,0,4480470.story|archivedate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[87th Academy Awards]] ceremony was held on February 22, 2015. Historically given during the first quarter of the new year, the awards honor achievements for cinematic accomplishments for the preceding year. For example, ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'' was awarded Best Picture for 2013, although the Oscar ceremony was conducted in 2014.

As of the [[87th Academy Awards]] ceremony held on February 22, 2015, a total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[first Academy Awards]] presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] with an audience of about 270 people. The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html|title=History of the Academy Awards|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhyVna9|archivedate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1929|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=0}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}}. Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the film-making industry of the time for their works during the 1927–28 period; the ceremony ran for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.

Winners had been announced to media three months earlier; however, that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930. Since then and during the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; This method was used until the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. The winners were recognized for all the work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.

At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award.

==Oscar statuette==

Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]], the [[Gordon E. Sawyer Award]], the [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]], the [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]], the [[John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation]], and the [[Student Academy Award]]) plus two awards that are not presented annually (the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette), the best known one is the ''Academy Award of Merit'' more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a knight rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusades|crusader's]] sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette|title= Oscar Statuette: Legacy|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 13 April 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172055/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette|archivedate= 2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[MGM]]'s art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award [[trophy]] by printing the design on a scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2000/00.05.03.html|title= Academy to Commemorate Oscar Designer Cedric Gibbons|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=3 May 2007|accessdate = 13 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202080413/http://www.oscars.org:80/press/pressreleases/2000/00.05.03.html|archivedate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In need of a model for his statuette, Gibbons was introduced by his future wife [[Dolores del Río]] to Mexican film director and actor [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández]]. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;. Then, sculptor [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]] (who also did the Muse Fountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm | title=Muse Fountain| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722114340/http://www.hollywoodbowl.com:80/about/history.cfm| archivedate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent [[tin]] and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the [[C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons]] Foundry in [[Batavia, Illinois]], which also contributed to casting the molds for the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] and [[Emmy Award]]s statuettes. Since 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/at_work.html#photo14| title=Eladio Gonzalez sands and buffs Oscar #3453| work=Boston Globe| date=20 February 2009| accessdate=21 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090223085458/http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/at_work.html| archivedate= 23 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer [[R.S.

===Naming===

The origin of the name ''Oscar'' is disputed. One biography of [[Bette Davis]] claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio|title= Bette Davis biography|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate = 13 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070308152931/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio| archivedate= 8 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term ''Oscar'' dates back to a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article about the 1934 [[6th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Oscars | date=26 March 1934| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813182253/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html | archivedate=2013-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walt Disney]] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://d23.disney.go.com/news/2010/03/oscar-winning-walt/|title= Oscar®-Winning Walt|publisher=Disney.Go.com|accessdate = 25 February 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130116193800/http://d23.disney.go.com/news/2010/03/oscar-winning-walt/|archivedate= 2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another claimed origin is that the Academy's Executive Secretary, [[Margaret Herrick]], first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot; (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oscar&quot; in ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', June 2008 Draft Revision.&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Levy| first = Emanuel| title = All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards| year = 2003| publisher = Burns &amp; Oates| isbn = 978-0-8264-1452-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy was officially dubbed the &quot;Oscar&quot; in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

===Engraving===
To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates.  Until 2010, winners were expected to return the statuettes to the Academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied.  Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a swanky party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony.  In 2010, the R. S. Owens company made 197 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony, bearing the names of every potential winner.  The 175 or so nameplates for non-winning nominees were recycled afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===
Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&lt;ref&gt;(Levy 2003, pg 28)&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2011, [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 Oscar for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' ([[Best Original Screenplay]]) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|title = Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar for sale|publisher = CNN|first = Alan|last = Duke|date = December 12, 2011|accessdate = December 12, 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131112025602/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|archivedate = 2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles' Oscar sold&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar brings $861,000|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|accessdate=April 7, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=December 21, 2011|author=Duke, Alan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116121806/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|archivedate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Harold Russell]] needed money for his wife's medical expenses. In a controversial decision, he consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions, and on August 6, 1992, in New York City, the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60,500. Russell defended his action, saying, &quot;I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't.&quot; Harold Russell is the only Academy Award winning actor to ever sell an Oscar.

While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.&lt;ref&gt;(Levy 2003, pg 29)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination==
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.

===Voters===
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,783 {{as of|lc=y|2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sandy Cohen | title=Academy Sets Oscars Contingency Plan | url=http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001 | work=AOL News | date=30 January 2008 | accessdate=19 March 2008| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090203061252/http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001| archivedate= 3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm|title = The men who are counting on Oscar|publisher=BBC News|author=Jackie Finlay|date=3 March 2006|accessdate =13 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm| archivedate= 19 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html|title = Academy Invites 115 to Become Members|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 4 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070827031611/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html  |archivedate = 27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by The Los Angeles Times was published which revealed the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horn|first=John|title=Unmasking the Academy|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory|accessdate=15 October 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=Feb 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307133844/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory|archivedate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | title=Electronic Voting Comes to The Oscars (Finally) | date=23 May 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105075132/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally/ | archivedate=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules===
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of 1 January to midnight at the end of 31 December, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate = 2013-11-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 awards]] as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards]].

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, except for short subject awards, and it must exist either on a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with native resolution not less than [[720p|1280×720]].

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In all major categories, voters use an [[instant runoff voting]] ballot, with potential nominees rewarded in the [[single transferable vote]] tally for having strong supporters who rank them first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://oscarvotes123.blogspot.com/2011/01/with-choice-voting-for-oscar.html|title = With choice voting for Oscar nominations, passion wins|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140108020452/http://oscarvotes123.blogspot.com/2011/01/with-choice-voting-for-oscar.html|archivedate = 2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories, like Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film, in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate = 2013-11-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in [[Oscar season]]. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics|first=Robert |last=Marich  |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |edition=3rd|year=2013 |pages=235–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a producer of the 2010 Best Picture nominee, ''[[The Hurt Locker]],'' was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as front-runner (''The Hurt Locker'' eventually won).

[[File:81st Academy Awards Ceremony.JPG|thumb|300px|81st Academy Awards Presentations, [[Dolby Theatre]], Hollywood, 2009]]
The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).

The Academy Awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all United States time zones (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in [[Alaska]] starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters|title=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher=Oscars.com| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090225132125/http://www.oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters |archivedate= 25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html |title=Nielsen – Press Release: The Nielsen Company's 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards |publisher=Nielsen.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213062344/http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html|archivedate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]) are broadcast live in the Eastern &amp; Central time zones, but are on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] on the West Coast and might not air the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.
The Awards show was first televised in 1953, on [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url =http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2011/20110224b.html|title= ABC and Academy Extend Oscar Telecast Agreement|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

By 1954, seven other countries, namely Brazil, Cuba, Venezuela, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, were already broadcasting the Awards show, although previously filmed into a condensed 60-minute version, called the &quot;International Edition&quot; of the Academy Awards. The Awards show was broadcast for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil purchased the rights to air the live event. By that time, the television rights to the Awards show were sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the TV rights to the Oscars were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries. Until the arrival of subscription television in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, which enabled the Oscars to be broadcast live through these territories, there was already available a previously filmed or taped 90-minute version of the Awards show which was aired on broadcast television in these territories. However, several Asian and Australasian countries, such as Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand were already carrying the live broadcast of the Awards show since the late 1970s. AMPAS still produces a condensed 90-minute version of the Academy Awards for those territories in which the rights to the live broadcast are expensive.

After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the [[Winter Olympics]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html|title = Emmys love for Oscars continues with 12 nominations

After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]/6:00 p.m [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern/5:30&amp;nbsp;pm Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|title = TV Notes; Moving Oscar Night|work=The New York Times |author=Bill Carter|date= 8 April 1998|accessdate = 8 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304185231/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|archivedate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19980701&amp;id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6637,43314 Academy Awards will move to Sunday night] Reading Eagle – 1 July 1998; From ''Google News Archive''&lt;/ref&gt; For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&amp;dat=19990319&amp;id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1224,4570799 Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday] The Item – 19 March 1999.

Originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the [[40th Academy Awards]] ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination of [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. On March 30, 1981, the [[53rd Academy Awards]] was postponed for one day, after [[Reagan assassination attempt|the shooting]] of President [[Ronald Reagan]] and others in Washington, D.C.

In 1993, an ''In Memoriam'' segment was introduced,&lt;ref name=&quot;fawcett&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/10/oscars-farrah-fawcett|title=Farrah Fawcett:Oscars director apologises for 'In Memoriam' omission|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=8 March 2010 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Child | date=10 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414020632/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/10/oscars-farrah-fawcett| archivedate= 14 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sandy|last=Cohen|title=Oscar's 'In Memoriam' segment is touching to watch, painful to make |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2010-03-03-oscar-memorial-segment_N.htm|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=USA Today |date=3 March 2010|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a &quot;[[popularity contest]]&quot; feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2000 ceremony lasted four hours and four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehbar, Ned (February 28, 2014). &quot;Did you know?&quot; ''Metro''. New York City. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners' [[Oscar speech|acceptance speeches]] must not run past 45&amp;nbsp;seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed &quot;the single most hated thing on the show&quot; – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/feb/16/oscar-winners-speeches-cut | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Cut … all change at Oscars as winners are given just 45&amp;nbsp;seconds to say thanks | first=Sam | last=Jones | date=16 February 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128143126/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/feb/16/oscar-winners-speeches-cut | archivedate=2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January ceremony would have to compete with [[National Football League]] playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/05/entertainment/la-et-oscars-20101005|title = Academy looks to move 2012 Oscar ceremony up several weeks

Historically, the &quot;Oscarcast&quot; has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the [[70th Academy Awards]] in 1998, the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers | first=Meg | last=James | date=23 February 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115833/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html | archivedate=2011-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm|work=USA Today |title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers | date=26 January 2005 | first=Scott | last=Bowles | accessdate=8 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on 7 April 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Justin Oppelaar |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |title=Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by '&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; |publisher=Variety.com |date=2002-10-09 |accessdate=2014-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118083655/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |archivedate=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budgeted, independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm | title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party |work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Levin | date=7 March 2006 | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 | title=Oscar ratings worst ever |work=The Washington Post |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330005242/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 |archivedate=2014-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'').

In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]].  From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles.

[[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academy's headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]].  With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the [[Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|NBC International Theatre]] (1953) and then at the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]], after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles.  The Oscars moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center]].

In 2002, the [[Dolby Theatre]] (formerly known as the [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] Theatre) became the current venue of the presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oscars' home renamed Dolby Theatre|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=May 1, 2012|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two separate categories (Drama and Comedy).  At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical).  From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories (black-and-white films and color films).  Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

Another award, entitled the [[Academy Award for Best Original Musical]], is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued.  However, due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year, it has not been awarded since 1984 (when ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' won).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule16.html |title=Music Awards &amp;#124; Rules for the 84th Academy Awards &amp;#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences |publisher=Oscars.org |date=2012-08-24 |accessdate=2014-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172058/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule16.html |archivedate=2013-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception and review==
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the &quot;[[Oscar season]]&quot;. This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality. [[William Friedkin]], an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Friedkin, William (Director) |date=24 February 2009|title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |accessdate=11 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090310081013/http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society| archivedate= 10 March 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was [[Dudley Nichols]] (Best Writing in 1935 for ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''). Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp|title=The Oscars Did You Know?|accessdate=18 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000022/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp| archivedate= 23 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'') at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony. Scott described it as a 'meat parade', saying 'I don't want any part of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=George C Scott: The man who refused an Oscar | date=23 September 1999| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095900/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm | archivedate=2014-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html | work=Time | title=Show Business: Meat Parade | date=8 March 1971| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221203341/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html | archivedate=2008-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=Fast Facts – Did You Know? |publisher=Biography.com |date=16 May 1929 |accessdate=6 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210075430/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp| archivedate= 10 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third was [[Marlon Brando]], who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans. At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando sent [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms.&lt;ref name=DYK/&gt;

Tim Dirks, editor of [[American Movie Classics|AMC's]] [[filmsite.org]], has written of the Academy Awards,

{{quote|Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence, and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking &quot;formula-made&quot; blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |title=Academy Awards – The Oscars |accessdate=4 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120093333/http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html|archivedate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies, and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. From 1927 to 2001 around 49% of Best Picture nominated films had been categorized as a drama and out of the 432 films to be analyzed within that time 47% of the winning films were in fact dramas. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |title=Academy Awards - The Oscars |accessdate=17 February 1015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the coining of the term '[[Oscar bait]]', describing such movies.  This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g. by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |accessdate=24 January 2012 | work=New York Post |first=Kyle |last=Smith|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115808/http://www.nypost.com:80/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |archivedate=2012-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presenter and performer gifts==
It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In recent years these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCGiftBag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Valenti|first=Catherine|title=No Oscar? How About a Gift Bag?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=86683|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425162335/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=86683|archivedate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of these gifts can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. In 2014 the value was reported to be as high as US$80,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSGiftBag&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Kim|title=Oscars' gift bag has $80,000 worth of swag|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscars-gift-bag-has-80000-worth-of-swag/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305230143/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscars-gift-bag-has-80000-worth-of-swag/|archivedate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value has risen to the point where the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.&lt;ref name=&quot;IRSGiftBag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=IRS Statement on Oscar Goodie Bags|url=http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Statement-on-Oscar-Goodie-Bags|publisher=IRS.gov|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311093138/http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Statement-on-Oscar-Goodie-Bags|archivedate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant, [[videophone]]s, a four-night stay at a hotel. Watches, bracelets, vacation packages, spa treatments, bottles of vodka, maple salad dressing, and weight-loss gummie candy.&lt;ref name=ABCGiftBag/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCGiftBag2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Valiente|first=Alexa|title=What Surprising Freebies Are Inside the 2014 Oscar Nominees' Gift Bags|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/surprising-freebies-inside-2014-oscar-nominees-gift-bags/story?id=22518285|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095026/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/surprising-freebies-inside-2014-oscar-nominees-gift-bags/story?id=22518285|archivedate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyGiftBag&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bacardi|first=Francesca|title=Oscar 'Losers' Become Winners with Distinctive Assets Gift Bags|url=http://variety.com/2014/film/news/oscar-losers-become-winners-with-distinctive-assets-gift-bags-1201100762/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095625/http://variety.com/2014/film/news/oscar-losers-become-winners-with-distinctive-assets-gift-bags-1201100762/|archivedate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the gifts have even had a &quot;risque&quot; element to them; in 2014 the adult products retailer [[Adam &amp; Eve (company)|Adam &amp; Eve]] had a &quot;Secret Room Gifting Suite&quot;.

'''''Actrius''''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Actresses'') is a 1996 film directed by [[Ventura Pons]]. In the film, there are no male actors and the four leading actresses dubbed themselves in the Castilian version.

==Synopsis==
In order to prepare the role of an important old actress, a theatre student interviews three actresses who were her pupils: an international diva (Glòria Marc, played by [[Núria Espert]]), a television star (Assumpta Roca, played by [[Rosa Maria Sardà]]) and a dubbing director (Maria Caminal, played by [[Anna Lizaran]]).

'''''Animalia''''' is an illustrated [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[Graeme Base]]. It was originally published in 1986, followed by a tenth anniversary edition in 1996 and a 25th anniversary edition in 2012. Over three million copies have been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puffin Books|title=Animalia 25th Anniversary Edition|url=http://www.puffin.com.au/products/9780670076673/animalia-25th-anniversary-edition|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A special numbered and signed anniversary edition was also published in 1996 with an embossed gold jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ABE Books|title=Animalia (Numbered and Signed anniversary edition)|url=http://www.abebooks.com/Animalia-Numbered-Signed-Anniversary-Edition-Base/3201558151/bd|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Animalia'' is an [[alliteration|alliterative]] [[alphabet]] book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet. Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words. The illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify. As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''International Atomic Time''' ('''TAI''', from the French name '''{{lang|fr|''Temps atomique international''}}'''&lt;ref&gt;Temps atomique 1975&lt;/ref&gt;) is a high-precision atomic [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on [[Earth]]'s [[geoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986CeMec..38..155G |title=Is the International Atomic Time TAI a coordinate time or a proper time? |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface, and for [[Terrestrial Time]], which is used for astronomical calculations. Since 30 June 2012 when the last [[leap second]] was added,&lt;ref name=&quot;bulletinc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= ftp://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.43 |title= Bulletin C 43: UTC time step on the 1st of July 2012 [sic] | publisher= [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS EOP PC]], [[Paris Observatory|Observatoire de Paris]] |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAI has been exactly 35 seconds ahead of UTC. The 35 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 25 [[leap second]]s in UTC since 1972.

Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.

==Operation==

TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 400 [[atomic clock]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iag.dgfi.badw.de/fileadmin/IAG-docs/Travaux2013/08_BIPM.pdf |title=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)  Time Department  | publisher=Report of the International Association of Geodesy 2011-2013 |date= |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.{{sfn|Time|n.d.}} The clocks are compared using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signals and [[two-way satellite time and frequency transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;Circular T 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone (see [[signal averaging]] for a discussion). The majority of the clocks are [[Atomic clock|caesium clocks]]; the definition of the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[second]] is written in terms of [[caesium]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp;Seidelmann 2009, 207, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

The participating institutions each broadcast, in [[real-time data|real time]], a frequency signal with [[timecode]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''UTC(NPL)'' in the UTC form, where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  The TAI form may be denoted ''TAI(NPL)''.  The latter is not to be confused with ''TA(NPL)'', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Time&quot; n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[Canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(''k'') (equivalent to TAI-TAI(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  (The same circular also gives tables of TAI-TA(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.)

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).

==History==
Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)]]. The &quot;Greenwich Atomic&quot; (GA) scale began in 1955 at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. The [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals. The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale  13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, [[Boulder, Colorado]].   Both the BIH scale and A.1 was defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: &quot;A3&quot; in 1963 and &quot;TA(BIH)&quot; in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 199&amp;ndash;201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.

In 1961, UTC began.  UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated [[UT2]] until the end of 1971, and [[UT1]] thereafter.  This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 227&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 the name International Atomic Time (TAI) was assigned to a time scale based on SI seconds with no leap seconds.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 202&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected. In 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates, but this was disproven in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;William Markowitz. &quot;Nondependence of Frequency on Mass: A Differential Experiment&quot; [[doi:10.1126/science.162.3860.1387]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann, 218&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated &quot;In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|325px|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.]]

'''Altruism''' or '''selflessness''' is the principle or practice of concern for the [[Quality of life|welfare]] of others. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of &quot;others&quot; toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of [[selfishness]]. The word was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of egoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teske|first1=Nathan|title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation|date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from an Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning &quot;other people&quot; or &quot;somebody else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=64|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=neAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action.

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]], in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether ''&quot;true&quot;'' altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an [[intrinsic]] reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as &quot;benefits.&quot;

The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self.

==The notion of altruism==
The concept has a long history in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.

== Individual variations ==
A certain individual may behave altruistically in one case and egotistically in another situation. However, some individuals tend to behave more altruistically, while others tend to behave more egotistically. Altruism may be considered a general attitude to the point where altruism has been considered as a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rushton |first1=J.P. |author2=Chrisjohn, R. D. and Fekken, G. C. |title=The altruistic personality and the self-report altruism scale|journal=Personality and Individual Differences |year=1981 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=293–302 |url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y3project/Rushton1981THE_ALTRUISTIC_PERSONALITY.pdf |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(81)90084-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1986 study estimated that altruism was half-[[Heritability|inherited]].&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;The study covered 5 related traits, giving a broad heritability estimate of 56% for altruism, but then approximated all to 50%, and raised the maximum-likelihood heritability to 60% after corrections for unreliability.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushton|first1=Jean Philippe |last2=Fulker|first2= D.

Also based on the twin design, the new study estimated that genetic differences accounted for approximately 20% of individual variations.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;The study generally refers to the trait studied as &quot;giving&quot;.

[[Marcel Mauss]]'s book ''The Gift'' contains a passage: &quot;Note on alms.&quot; This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand,
and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis
avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth
of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the
gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that
the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been
hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[evolutionary psychology]] this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping]], courtship gifts, production of [[public good]]s, and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AEP1&quot;&gt;Pat Barcaly.

Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from [[evolutionary game theory]] a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
* [[Kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biological Altruism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/#2|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helping behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social [[ingroup]]s suffer or even disappear. Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist. Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness. Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] threatens to kill the entire ingroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/406755|last1=Trivers|first1=R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|pages=35–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reciprocity (evolution)]].
** Direct [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.7466396 |author=R Axelrod and WD Hamilton |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=211 |issue=4489 |date=27 March 1981 |pages=1390–1396 |pmid=7466396 |bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help. The effective [[tit for tat]] strategy is one [[game theory|game theoretic]] example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

::One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a &quot;Community Game&quot; instead of a &quot;Wall Street Game.&quot;&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

::A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

::People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

** Indirect reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature04131|author=Martin Nowak &amp; Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=437|issue=27|date=October 2005|pages=1291–1298|pmid=16251955|bibcode = 2005Natur.437.1291N }}&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's [[reputation]] to become very important. A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** [[Strong reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Herbert Gintis]]|title=Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]|volume=206|issue=2|date=September 2000|pmid=10966755|pages=169–179|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2111}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism. A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence.
** Pseudo-reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, Chapter 11|isbn=0-262-08326-4|publisher=Dahlem Workshop Reports|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist.
* [[Signalling theory|Costly signaling]] and the [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/3677205|last1=Zahavi|first1=A.|year=1995|title=Altruism as a handicap – The limitations of kin selection and reciprocity|jstor=3677205|journal=Avian Biol|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an &quot;honest signal&quot; of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources. This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

[[File:FEMA - 15337 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-10-2005 in Texas.jpg|thumb|Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the [[Houston Astrodome]], following Hurricane Katrina.]]
:Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt; Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;AEP2&quot;&gt;Wendy Iredal and Mark van Vugt. Altruism as showing off: a signaling perspective on promoting green behaviour and acts of kindness. In {{cite doi|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners. When looking for a long-term partner more conventional altruism may be preferred which may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children while when looking for a short-term partner heroic risk-taking, which may be costly signal showing good genes, may be more preferable. Men also perform more altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

:People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Group selection]]. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[E. O. Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also [[in-group favoritism]]). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh

[[File:Helping the homeless.jpg|right|thumb|Helping the homeless in New York City]]
Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides.'' These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.

Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1701_01|last1=Brown|first1=S.L.|last2=Brown|first2=R.M.|year=2006|title=Selective investment theory: Recasting the functional significance of close relationships|url=http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Psychological Inquiry|volume=17|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icts.res.in/media/uploads/Talk/Document/StLouis2011TelmoFIN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' and [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]].''

Most recently, [[Jeremy Griffith]] has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce, as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith J. 2011. ''Conscience''. In ''The Book of Real Answers to Everything!'' ISBN 9781741290073. http://www.worldtransformation.com/conscience/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiology===
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623–15628&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Another experiment funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and conducted in 2007 at the [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]] suggests a different view, &quot;that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/61312.php &quot;Brain Scan Predicts Difference Between Altruistic And Selfish People&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the study published in the February 2007 print issue of [[Nature Neuroscience]], researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people.

The researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game. In some rounds, the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves, and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer's choice. During these activities, the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) scans of the participants' brains and were &quot;surprised by the results&quot;. Although they &quot;were expecting to see activity in the brain's reward centers,&quot; based on the idea that &quot;people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it,&quot; what they found was that &quot;another part of the brain was also involved, and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else's gain.&quot; That part of the brain is called the posterior superior [[temporal cortex]] (pSTC).

In the next stage, the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours. They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person's tendency to act altruistically and compared each person's level of altruism against their [[fMRI]] [[brain scan]]. The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a person's self-reported level of altruism. According to the researchers, the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it. &quot;We believe that the ability to perceive other people's actions as meaningful is critical for altruism,&quot; said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070121162756.htm &quot;Activation Of Brain Region Predicts Altruism&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines ''psychological altruism'' as &quot;a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare.&quot; Psychological altruism is contrasted with ''psychological egoism,'' which refers to the motivation to increase one’s own welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;&gt;[&quot;Altruism.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.

There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.&lt;ref name=&quot;batson3&quot;&gt;[Batson, C. (2011). Altruism in humans. New York, NY US: Oxford University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosocial&quot;&gt;[Batson, C. (2012). A history of prosocial behavior research. In A. W. Kruglanski, [[Wolfgang Stroebe|W. Stroebe]], A. W. Kruglanski, (Eds.), Handbook of the history of social psychology (pp. 243–264). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The [[social exchange theory]] postulates that altruism only exists when benefits outweigh costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;noaltruism&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maner | first1 = J.

He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle ([[principlism]]). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.&lt;ref name=&quot; baston2&quot;&gt;[Batson, C., Ahmad, N., &amp; Stocks, E.

New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis'' basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svetlova|first1=M.|last2=Nichols|first2=S.

In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosocial&quot;/&gt; Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the ''[[Bystander effect]]''). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Bruckman | first2 = Amy S. | year = 2004 | title = The Bystander Effect: A Lens for Understanding Patterns of Participation | url = | journal = Journal of the Learning Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 165–195 | doi = 10.1207/s15327809jls1302_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=van der Linden, S.|title=Charitable Intent: A Moral or Social Construct?

It is important to note that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder.

===Sociology===
&quot;Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society&quot; (&quot;Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity&quot;. American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm American Sociological Association: Altruism, Morality and Social Solidarity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges [[Public sociology]] saying, &quot;The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable&quot; (&quot;Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity&quot; ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and &quot;build the good society&quot;.

==Religious viewpoints==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]] and [[Sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Monks collecting alms - Bun Vat Phu.JPG|thumb|Monks collecting alms]]
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. &quot;Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being&quot; (Dalai Lama).&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm Speech by the Dalai Lama]&lt;br&gt;The phrase &quot;core of our being&quot; is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since &quot;all beings&quot; includes the individual, love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other. It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering. In practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as &quot;altruistic.&quot; Many would agree with the [[Dalai Lama]] that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others.

Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: &quot;The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes&quot; (Dalai Lama&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;/&gt;).

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause: if I cause suffering, then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering; if I cause happiness, then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness.

{{Main|Karma in Buddhism}}
In Buddhism, ''karma'' (Pāli ''kamma'') is strictly distinguished from '''''[[vipaka|vipāka]]''''', meaning &quot;fruit&quot; or &quot;result&quot;. Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (Pāli ''hetu'') in the [[Twelve nidanas|chain]] of [[Pratitya-samutpada|cause and effect]], where it comprises the elements of &quot;volitional activities&quot; (Pali ''sankhara'') and &quot;action&quot; (Pali ''bhava''). Any action is understood to create &quot;seeds&quot; in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (Pāli ''vipaka'') when they meet the right conditions. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of [[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsāra]]; others will liberate one to [[nirvana|nirvāna]].

Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. Motivation usually makes the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be &quot;bad&quot; in that it creates unpleasant results for the &quot;actor.&quot;

In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens. As taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Davids| first = Rhys| title = Buddhism| url = http://books.google.com/?id=LljcZ_LBeL0C&amp;pg=PA119| year = 2007| publisher = Lightning Source Incorporated| isbn = 978-1-4067-5628-9| page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Padmasiri de Silva| title = Environmental Philosophy and Ethics in Buddhism| url = http://books.google.com/?id=M4T3C6ndfZIC&amp;pg=PA41| year = 1998| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-21316-9| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Utu Niyama — Seasonal changes and climate

===Jainism===
The fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of [[Ahimsa]] – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Thirthankar, Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.

Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
# Non-violence (Ahimsa);
# Truthfulness (Satya);
# Non-stealing (Asteya);
# Celibacy (Brahmacharya);
# Non-possession or non-materialism (Aparigraha);

A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride (ego) by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.

The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (Param-atma – &quot;highest soul&quot;). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders. The &quot;great vows&quot; (mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and &quot;limited vows&quot; (anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. In other words, the house-holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.

===Christianity===
[[File:StThomasMount Theresa.JPG|thumb|180px|Statue of [[Mother Teresa]] in India]]
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the [[Gospel]], especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love&quot;, as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests.&quot; In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception,'' Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.

[[St Thomas Aquinas]] interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself'&lt;ref&gt;[[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22&lt;/ref&gt; as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'', II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that &quot;the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship&quot; and quotes Aristotle that &quot;the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nichomachean Ethics]] IX.4 1166a1&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, &quot;motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way is merely &quot;one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, &quot;love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], the concept 'īthār' (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by Allah on the human body, considered to be property of Allah alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = M| title = Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart| year = 2004| publisher = Fountain| location = Rutherford, N.J.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for [[Allah]] (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob Eds| title = Altruism in World Religions| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ. Press| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = 1-58901-065-5| pages = 79–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to [[Allah]] (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]] explained this philosophy as &quot;Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü&quot; or ''We love the creature, because of The Creator.'' For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.

===Judaism===
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=Ben Zion Bokser |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac| title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems| year = 1978| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as [[Corporate welfare|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. [[Kabbalah]] defines God as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Luzzatto| first = Moshe Ḥayyim| title = The way of God| year = 1997| publisher = Feldheim Publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 120–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 175–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. 
The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness.
The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev Sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth.  The ninth Nanak, Guru Tegh Bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late sventeenth century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Moghul]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield.
&quot;What were you doing, and why?&quot; asked the Guru. &quot;I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them,&quot; replied Bhai Kanhaiya.
The Guru responded, &quot;Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.&quot;

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = O. P. Ralhan| title = The great gurus of the Sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd.| location = New Delhi| isbn = 81-7488-479-3| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}

There exists a wide range of philosophical views on man's obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which is the view that every individual's well-being (including one's own) is of equal moral importance.

A related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[Rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

'''Ayn Rand''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|n|_|ˈ|r|æ|n|d}};&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=71}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum'''; {{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}} – March 6, 1982) was a [[Russian-American]] [[novelist]], philosopher,&lt;!-- DO NOT REMOVE WITHOUT CONSENSUS --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=x}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Kukathas|1998|p=55}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; playwright, and screenwriter. She is known for her two best-selling novels, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', and for developing a philosophical system she called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Born and educated in [[Russian American|Russia]], Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, ''The Fountainhead''.

In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel ''Atlas Shrugged''. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated [[reason]] as the only means of acquiring [[knowledge]] and rejected faith and religion. She supported [[rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]], and rejected [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. In politics, she condemned the [[initiation of force]] as immoral&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barry|1987|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=309–314}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=298}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed [[collectivism]] and [[statism]] as well as [[anarchism]], instead supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], which she defined as the system based on recognizing [[individual rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rights&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|pp=91–92}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=379–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In art, Rand promoted [[romantic realism]]. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some [[Aristotelians]] and [[classical liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1977|pp=18–20}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=12, 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;growing&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=David |url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/dec/07/internationaleducationnews.highereducation |title=A growing concern |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=December 7, 2001 |location=London |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marcus |first=Jon |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/407357.article |title=Ayn Rand revival gathers pace in US universities, despite detractors |work=Times Higher Education |date=July 16, 2009 |accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Badhwar 2010&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Objectivist movement]] attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;reception&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been a significant influence among [[libertarians]] and [[American conservatives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;politicalinfluence&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=107–108, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
Rand was born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum ({{lang-ru|Али́са Зиновьевна Розенбаум}}) on February 2, 1905, to a [[Russian Jew]]ish [[bourgeois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; family living in [[Saint Petersburg]]. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan), largely non-observant [[Jews]]. Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman, eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=3–5}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a passion for the liberal arts, Rand later said she found school unchallenging and she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=The Tomorrow Show|credit=Tom Snyder|network=NBC|airdate=July 2, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates: while Nabokova defended constitutional monarchy, Rand supported republican ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was twelve at the time of the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, during which she favored [[Alexander Kerensky]] over [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II]].

The subsequent [[October Revolution]] and the rule of the [[Bolshevik]]s under [[Vladimir Lenin]] disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father’s business was confiscated and the family displaced. They fled to the [[Crimean Peninsula]], which was initially under control of the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. She later recalled that, while in high school, she determined that she was an [[atheist]] and that she valued [[reason]] above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=14–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spb 06-2012 University Embankment 06.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Twelve Collegia of what was then Petrograd State University|Rand completed a three-year program at [[Petrograd State University]].]]
After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at [[Petrograd State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, at the age of only 16, she began her studies in the department of [[social pedagogy]], majoring in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the university she was introduced to the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1999|pp=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=451–460}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17–18, 22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Edmond Rostand]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]], who became her perennial favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with many other &quot;bourgeois&quot; students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating. However, after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Rand did in October 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1999|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently studied for a year at the State [[Technicum]] for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For one of her assignments, she wrote an essay about the Polish-American actress [[Pola Negri]], which became her first published work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller49-50&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as a [[Cyrillic]] contraction of her birth surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she adopted the first name ''Ayn'', either from a [[Finnish language|Finnish]] name ''[[Aino (given name)|Aino]]'' or from the [[Hebrew]] word {{lang|he| עין}} (''ayin'', meaning &quot;eye&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Rand said the origin of ''Ayn'' was Finnish {{harv|Rand|1995|p=40}}, but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname. {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=55–57}} provides a detailed discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival in the United States===
[[File:Pola Negri by Ayn Rand cover.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A brown book cover with black-and-white drawings and text in Russian. The drawing on the left is a portrait of a woman with dark hair; the drawing on the right is of skyscrapers.|Cover of Rand's first published work, a 2,500-word monograph on ''femme fatale'' [[Pola Negri]] published in 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller49-50&quot;/&gt;]]
In the autumn of 1925, Rand was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit American relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She departed on January 17, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of [[Manhattan]] that she cried what she later called &quot;tears of splendor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with relatives in [[Chicago]], one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then set out for [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. A chance meeting with famed director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to a job as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] in his film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on ''The King of Kings'', she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929, around the time her last visa extension was set to expire. She became a [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent US resident]] in July 1929, and [[United States nationality law#Naturalization|became an American citizen]] on March 3, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=39}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=35–40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|pp=74, 81, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=96–98}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=43–44, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early fiction===
{{See also|Night of January 16th|We the Living|Anthem (novella)}}
Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' to [[Universal Studios]] in 1932, although it was never produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=40, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the courtroom drama ''[[Night of January 16th]]'', first produced by [[E.E. Clive]] in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1935. Each night the &quot;jury&quot; was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's &quot;verdict&quot;, would then be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=76, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[Paramount Pictures]] produced a [[The Night of January 16th (film)|movie loosely based on the play]]. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=78}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first novel, the semi-autobiographical ''[[We the Living]]'', was published in 1936. Set in [[Soviet Russia]], it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that ''We the Living'' &quot;is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |chapter=Foreword |title=We the Living |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |page=xviii |isbn=0-525-94054-5 |oclc=32780458 |edition=60th Anniversary |year=1995 |origyear=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; although European editions continued to sell.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira''. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''[[We the Living (film)|We the Living]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, ''The Fountainhead''. It presents a vision of a [[dystopian]] future world in which [[totalitarian]] collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with ''We the Living'', Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''Anthem''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Fountainhead'' and political activism===
{{See also|The Fountainhead|The Fountainhead (film)}}
During the 1940s, Rand became politically active. Both she and her husband worked full-time in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican [[Wendell Willkie]]. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro-Willkie [[newsreels]], an experience she greatly enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]] and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Once Mises referred to Rand as &quot;the most courageous man in America&quot;, a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said &quot;man&quot; instead of &quot;woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=114}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=249}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer [[Isabel Paterson]]. Rand questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book, ''[[The God of the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=75–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first major success as a writer came with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' in 1943, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=61–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named [[Howard Roark]] and his struggle against what Rand described as &quot;second-handers&quot;—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed [[Benzedrine]], a brand of [[amphetamine]], to fight fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel, but when the book was done, she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=304–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fountainhead'' eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=149}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a [[The Fountainhead (film)|film version]] to [[Warner Bros.]], and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer [[Hal Wallis]] as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Love Letters (1945 film)|Love Letters]]'' and ''[[You Came Along]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=68–80}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=183–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''. Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled &quot;The Only Path to Tomorrow&quot;, in the January 1944 edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Ayn Rand's testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities}}
Rand extended her involvement with free-market and [[anti-communist]] activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]], a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist [[American Writers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=100–101, 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the United States [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|pp=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several delays, the film version of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she &quot;disliked the movie from beginning to end&quot;, complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Atlas Shrugged'' and Objectivism===
{{See also|Atlas Shrugged|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist movement}}
In the years following the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom it profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated &quot;The Collective&quot;) included future [[Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and Barbara's cousin [[Leonard Peikoff]]. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, ''Atlas Shrugged'', as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=256–264, 331–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Atlas Shrugged'', published in 1957, was considered Rand's ''[[magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=113}}; {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand described the theme of the novel as &quot;the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;''Atlas Shrugged'' on the Role of the Mind in Man's Existence&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists go on [[strike action|strike]] and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes the strike as &quot;stopping the motor of the world&quot; by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of [[Romance novel|romance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dowd |first=Maureen |authorlink=Maureen Dowd |title=Atlas Without Angelina |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/opinion/17dowd.html |date=April 17, 2011 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=July 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|p=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]], and [[science fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.

Despite many negative reviews, ''Atlas Shrugged'' became an international bestseller, and in an interview with [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]], Rand declared herself &quot;the most creative thinker alive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the novel, Rand fell into a severe depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=303–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlas Shrugged'' was Rand's last completed work of fiction; a turning point in her life, it marked the end of Rand's career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASturningpoint&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2000|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for [[Objectivist periodicals]] that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the [[Objectivist movement]] itself as a [[cult]] or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=105–106}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=237–238}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=329}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=235}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as [[Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=315–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard]], and [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received an honorary doctorate from [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also began delivering annual lectures at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], responding afterward to questions from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these speeches and Q&amp;A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposing the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[military draft]] (but condemning many [[draft dodgers]] as &quot;bums&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=228–229, 265}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting [[Israel]] in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as &quot;civilized men fighting savages&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] had the right to take land from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calling [[homosexuality]] &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;, while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=362, 519}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also endorsed several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates for President of the United States, most strongly [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for ''The Objectivist Newsletter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=204–206}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ayn Rand Marker.jpg|thumb|left|Grave marker for Rand and her husband at [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]]|alt=A twin gravestone bearing the name &quot;Frank O'Connor&quot; on the left, and &quot;Ayn Rand O'Connor&quot; on the right]]
In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott,&lt;!--note: spelling is correct, please do not remove--&gt; whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=344–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand published an article in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other &quot;irrational behavior in his private life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=378–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branden later apologized in an interview to &quot;every student of Objectivism&quot; for &quot;perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique&quot; and for &quot;contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=386–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand underwent surgery for [[lung cancer]] in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=391–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, allowed Evva Pryor, a social worker from her attorney's office, to enroll her in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|pp=520–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|2012|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=392–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand died of [[heart failure]] on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=405, 410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including [[Alan Greenspan]]. A {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her will, Rand named [[Leonard Peikoff]] the heir to her estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{Objectivist movement}}{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Rand called her philosophy &quot;Objectivism&quot;, describing its essence as &quot;the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–1171}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered Objectivism a [[systematic philosophy]] and laid out positions on [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=224}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In metaphysics, Rand supported [[philosophical realism]], and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, Douglas J. &amp; Rasmussen, Douglas B. &quot;Ayn Rand's Realism&quot;. In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[epistemology]], she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered [[axiom]]atic,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reason]], which she described as &quot;the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge, including &quot;'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing.{{' &quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'', Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the [[analytic–synthetic dichotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1997}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ethics, Rand argued for [[rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should &quot;exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1989|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She referred to egoism as &quot;the virtue of selfishness&quot; in her [[The Virtue of Selfishness|book of that title]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kukathas&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kukathas|1998|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she presented her solution to the [[is-ought problem]] by describing a [[meta-ethical]] theory that based morality in the needs of &quot;man's survival ''qua'' man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=207, 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness,&lt;ref name=&quot;Badhwar 2010&quot;/&gt; and held that the [[initiation of force]] was evil and irrational, writing in ''Atlas Shrugged'' that &quot;Force and mind are opposites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1023}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=313–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's political philosophy emphasized [[individual rights]] (including [[Private property|property rights]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=350–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she considered ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;rights&quot;/&gt; She opposed [[statism]], which she understood to include [[theocracy]], [[absolute monarchy]], [[Nazism]], [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[democratic socialism]], and [[dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although her political views are often classified as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or [[libertarian]], she preferred the term &quot;radical for capitalism&quot;. She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=174–177, 209, 230–231}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=225–226}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=189–190}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with [[anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=266–267}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in [[subjectivism]] that could only lead to collectivism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=280–281}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=371–372}}; {{harvnb|Merrill|1991|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's aesthetics defined art as a &quot;selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments.&quot; According to Rand, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered [[romanticism]] to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described her own approach to literature as &quot;[[romantic realism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=207}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand acknowledged [[Aristotle]] as her greatest influence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked that in the [[history of philosophy]] she could only recommend &quot;three A's&quot;—Aristotle, [[Aquinas]], and Ayn Rand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sciabarra1995p12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1959 interview with [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]], when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded, &quot;Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podritske|Schwartz|2009|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she also found early inspiration in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=16, 22}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=100–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|pp=136, 138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; in passages from the first edition of ''We the Living'' (which Rand later revised),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|1991|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=135}}; Loiret-Prunet, Valerie. &quot;Ayn Rand and Feminist Synthesis: Rereading ''We the Living''&quot;.

In {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time she wrote ''The Fountainhead'', Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=41, 68}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Merrill|1991|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=303–304}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|pp=135, 137–138}}; Mayhew, Robert. &quot;''We the Living'' '36 and '59&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was [[Immanuel Kant]], whom she referred to as a &quot;monster&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1971|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although philosophers George Walsh&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Seddon&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seddon|2003|pp=63–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.

Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her &quot;theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution]] |chapter=The Left: Old and New |page=62 |isbn=0-452-01184-1 |oclc=39281836 |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Meridian |last=Rand |first=Ayn |others=Edited by Peter Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating, &quot;I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1971|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, ''We the Living'', was admired by the literary critic [[H. L.

Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden 122-124&quot;/&gt; Rand believed that her first novel, ''We the Living'', was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says &quot;it was the most reviewed of any of her works&quot;, with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;Reviews of ''We the Living''&quot;.

Rand's first bestseller, ''The Fountainhead'', received far fewer reviews than ''We the Living'', and reviewers' opinions were mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;''The Fountainhead'' Reviews&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2006|pp=77–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a positive review in ''The New York Times'' that Rand greatly appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer called Rand &quot;a writer of great power&quot; who wrote &quot;brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly&quot;, and stated that &quot;you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pruette&quot;/&gt; There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt; Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt; such as one that called it &quot;a whale of a book&quot; and another that said &quot;anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing&quot;. Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style &quot;offensively pedestrian&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt;

She faced intense opposition from [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and other contributors for the ''[[National Review]]'' magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by [[Whittaker Chambers]], [[Garry Wills]], and [[M. Stanton Evans]].

===Academic reaction===
During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;reception&quot;/&gt; When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand &quot;a treacherous undertaking&quot; that could lead to &quot;guilt by association&quot; for taking her seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1977|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in ''[[The Personalist]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein115&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by libertarian philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], who argued that her [[meta-ethical]] argument is unsound and fails to solve the [[is–ought problem]] posed by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Randian Argument |last=Nozick |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Nozick |journal=[[The Personalist]] |date=Spring 1971 |volume=52 |pages=282–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in ''The Personalist'' arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein115&quot; /&gt; Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2003|pp=373–374, 379–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=114–122}}; {{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1995}}; {{cite journal |last=McLemee |first=Scott |url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html |title=The Heirs Of Ayn Rand: Has Objectivism Gone Subjective? |journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]] |date=September 1999 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=45–55 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110515004459/http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Jennifer Burns has identified &quot;three overlapping waves&quot; of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is &quot;an explosion of scholarship&quot; since the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstein, [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[Edwin A. Locke]] and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]] have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the ''[[Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', a nonpartisan [[peer-reviewed journal]] dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley, and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|pp=2, 25}}; {{cite journal |first=William |last=Thomas |title=Ayn Rand Through Two Lenses |journal=Navigator |date=April 2000 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=15–19 |url=http://www.atlassociety.org/on-ayn-rand-gotthelf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'', a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by [[Cambridge University Press]].

Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and [[Douglas B. Rasmussen]], while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as &quot;literary, hyperbolic and emotional&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1978|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite &quot;the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage&quot;, Rand's ethics are &quot;a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Jack. &quot;Rand and Aristotle&quot;. In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|Literary Encyclopedia]]'' entry for Rand written in 2001, [[John David Lewis]] declared that &quot;Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=John David |authorlink=John David Lewis |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3705 |work=[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|The Literary Encyclopedia]] |title=Ayn Rand |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |date=October 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 interview in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Sciabarra commented, &quot;I know they laugh at Rand&quot;, while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharlet |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Sharlet (writer) |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Ayn-Rand-Has-Finally-Caught/20237/ |title=Ayn Rand Has Finally Caught the Attention of Scholars |date=April 9, 1999 |volume=45 |issue=31 |pages=A17–A18 |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian philosopher [[Michael Huemer]] has argued that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics,&lt;ref name=&quot;whyrand&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Huemer |url=http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/01/22/michael-huemer/why-ayn-rand-some-alternate-answers |title=Why Ayn Rand? Some Alternate Answers |work=[[Cato Unbound]] |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Humer |title=Is Benevolent Egoism Coherent? |work=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]] |volume=3 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2002 |pages=259–288 |url=http://aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars3-2/jars3_2mhuemer.pdf |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110915095043/http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars3-2/jars3_2mhuemer.pdf |archivedate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributes the attention she receives to her being a &quot;compelling writer&quot;, especially as a novelist. Thus, ''Atlas Shrugged'' outsells not only the works of other philosophers of [[classical liberalism]] such as [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], or [[Frederic Bastiat]], but also Rand's own non-fiction works.&lt;ref name=&quot;whyrand&quot;/&gt;

Political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only &quot;philosophical debt&quot; was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as [[John Locke]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1708/article_detail.asp |publisher=The Claremont Institute |title=Who is Ayn Rand? |first=Charles |last=Murray |year=2010 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131501431000/http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1708/article_detail.asp |archivedate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert H. |last=Bass |title=Egoism versus Rights |work=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]] |volume=7 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2006 |pages=329–349 |url=http://aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars7-2/jars7_2rbass1.pdf |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20121105111109/http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars7-2/jars7_2rbass1.pdf |archivedate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectivist movement===
{{Main|Objectivist movement}}
In 1985, Rand's heir Leonard Peikoff established the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, philosopher [[David Kelley]] founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as [[The Atlas Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=280–281}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=19, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charitable foundation of [[BB&amp;T Corporation]] has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=116–117}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alain Connes''' ({{IPA-fr|alɛ̃ kɔn|lang}}; born 1 April 1947) is a French [[mathematician]], currently Professor at the [[Collège de France]], [[IHÉS]], [[The Ohio State University]] and [[Vanderbilt University]].

==Work==
Alain Connes studies [[operator algebra]]s. In his early work on [[von Neumann algebras]] in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. Following this he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the 
[[Baum-Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative differential geometry]].

Connes has applied his work in areas of [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], including [[number theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-geometer-of-particle Scientific Americain, ''The Geometer of Particle Physics'', 24 July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

Connes was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982, the [[Crafoord Prize]] in 2001 and the gold medal of the [[CNRS]] in 2004.  He is a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and several foreign academies and societies, including the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|Danish Academy of Sciences]], [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|Norwegian Academy of Sciences]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]].

'''Allan Dwan''' (3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, Dwan moved with his family to the United States when he was eight (8) years old, on April 15, 1893. At the [[University of Notre Dame]], he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Brownlow 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Brownlow, Kevin |title=The Parade's Gone By . . . |publisher=Ballantine Books, Inc. |location=New York |year=1969 |pages=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]]. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

==Career==
Dwan operated [[Flying A Studios]] in [[La Mesa, California]] from August 1911 to July 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6833|title=La mesa to honor its tinseltown roots aug. 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamesa.patch.com/articles/100-simple-melodramas-were-made-in-la-mesa-100-years-ago|title=Proto-Hollywood: 100 Melodramas Were Made In La Mesa 100 Years Ago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Ave and La Mesa Bl commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]]. 

After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Dwan directed [[Gloria Swanson]] in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process [[Phonofilm]]. This short, also featuring [[Thomas Meighan]] and [[Henri de la Falaise]], was produced as a joke, for the 26 April 1925 &quot;Lambs' Gambol&quot; for [[The Lambs]], with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club. 

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], Dwan directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' (1937) and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938).

Dwan helped launch the career of two other very successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed over 400&amp;nbsp;motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]].

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].
